## Project Title
udacity-datascience-nanodegree Disaster Response Pipeline Project for Shayan Ray

## Summary of the project

The goal of this project was to:
- build a ETL pipeline to extract, transform and load the data in a SQLLite DB
- build a NLP/ML pipeline to use the messages from people in disaster struck areas and classify them into 36 categories
- integrate them into a web-app with the option to enter a new message for classification and create visualizations for exploratory data analysis.

## Installation Instructions
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Go to `app` directory: `cd app`

3. Run your web app: `python run.py`
