This was our first time going through Airbnb and it was a very positive experience.  Ryan's home was perfect for our family vacation.  Our family consists of two adults and two teenagers (ages 18 and 17) and we had plenty of space to all have our own bedrooms but still a small enough home that made it very cozy where we could spend quality time together.  
The gourmet kitchen was beautifully appointed which made cooking several meals fun and easy.  In addition, we appreciated the many small touches such as the soft bath towels and the organic sweet smelling hand soaps.  The residential location was great and we were able to walk to the local coffee shop and restaurants and spend beautiful mornings walking around Green Lake.  Grocery stores are an easy 5-10 minute drive from the house and it's easy access to both I-5 and I-99. This home would be great for small families like ours wanting to take a campus visit to the University of Washington or explore the many sights of Seattle.  We would stay here again without hesitation."

The neighborhood felt very warm.  The parking is limited on the street, but on our 3 days there, we never had a problem finding a space.  
The Studio--The studio was exactly like the picture.   Large space which also includes are large closet which I didn't see mentioned in any of the other reviews.  Megan mentioned noise from her 7 yr old.  We heard occasional footsteps, but nothing that was bothersome; otherwise the studio was extremely quiet. We didn't cook although the kitchen seemed to be fully stocked with utensils.  There were many canned lights and basement style windows which made you forget that you were in the basement.  I need a lot of light to feel comfortable and the studio had what I needed.  The studio is beautifully decorated with maple counter tops and a cork bathroom floor.  This was a concern for me because I was afraid that I might damage some of the finishes.  Both are sensitive to water and I felt like I had to be very careful.  Megan has dish towels and bath mats available to make keeping the finishes looking good easy.  If you are a slob, this may not be the place for you.

Kris is a very accommodating and generous host.  She provided me with a key for 24 hour access, kitchen and laundry privileges, and a comfortable couch for sleeping.  It is a one bedroom, one bathroom, basement level apartment, probably 1970's era, with a combined living/kitchen space so there is no real expectation of privacy but Kris is very respectful of the shared space and really extends herself on behalf of her guest.  I walked to the water taxi (about 1/2 hour walk) to access downtown Seattle but there is also a bus stop on the corner so a car is not necessary. 
This was both my first Airbnb booking and my first couch surfing experience so I had some trepidation about safety.  I took a chance based on positive earlier reviews and a willingness to lose my money and bail out if I didn't feel safe.  Needless to say, there are no worries on that account.  Kris offers a sweet deal if you want to be in West Seattle to enjoy a beach experience and really just need a safe, comfortable space to land at night."

It was the perfect space for the two of us and Julie was an amazing host. She was attentive yet allowed us private use of her beautiful back yard. We considered kidnapping her to come landscape our home! It is a zen retreat in the middle of a bustling city and is perfect for a couple or single person. I don't know how well it would work for families but I did see she had extra bedding gear available.  Tips and tricks: if you're like us and are used to a dark bedroom you might want to consider an eye mask. The window shades here are light and there are also great skylights but it all makes for bright mornings! :) Second tip it took us a minute to figure out: the best way to get some cool air in at night is to crank open the windows and clip the shade up a bit. Works so much better than the fan on the window unit (and you don't need air at night in Seattle with the cool temps).  Again, all the positive reviews are for real; Julie's has created such a unique space and we recommend it completely. "

As hosts we give guests their space and let them contact us if they need anything. We let guests check in without having to meet up to avoid any inconvenience. Unfortunately that means we don't always meet each guest, but we want to respect their privacy if that is what they prefer.

Lara and I exchanged sentiment via email about our families and I felt like I knew her before I even arrived. The reason that my girlfriend and I stayed in Seattle over Labor Day, 2015, was to celebrate our one-year anniversary. We have a eight-week old daughter (my mother watched her for the first two nights), that we were missing, but we also had plans that included Sounder's tickets for Saturday night. Lara offered to watch our little girl for the few hours that we'd be at the game. So, after my mother spent the day with us in Seattle, and dropped off our baby, we knew that we had babysitting arranged by our host. That kind of service will never be replicated by a hotel. Unfortunately, plans didn't work out that way (we were enjoying ourselves down by the waterfront too much and didn't have enough time to make it back to the cabin before the game. The offer was so unexpected, genuine, and nice though that there is no way I wasn't going to mention it. I had planned this amazing four days in Seattle, which included a movie in the park, but we had so much luggage that we couldn't fit blankets in the car. Lara let us borrow four blankets, and they were definitely needed on that cold September night. As for the cabin itself, it was very cozy. The heaters did a great job warming the space, and everything you needed was provided. The room is nice and bright with natural lighting, and there are plenty of interior lights for when the sun goes down. All in all, it was an amazing space with a wonderful host, and Crystal and I will always keep it in mind for future stay-cations!!"

Privacy. Space. Sam and Lish have a great place in a quiet neighborhood in a hilly area of Seattle. It's not too far from downtown but also close to the arboretum, university, the Husky stadium and Seattle Children's Hospital, which is ideal for families visiting students, attending games or getting checkups. We had the downstairs all to ourselves with private entrance and fenced off patio area. A downstairs apt can seem dank, but this one has plenty of windows and Sam and Lish have it painted brightly, with both ceiling and lamp lighting. We had plenty of space to unwind, with a comfy bed, couch, work desk, rocking chair and reading nook. The kitchen and laundry room provided extra convenience. It is an older home, so you may notice creaking floors and voices above, but this is probably typical of any airbnb where you share space in one home. I appreciated the coffee and hot water percolator too! Most welcome was a list of favorite dining places in the area. Finally, I would say that Sam and Lish were really accommodating as we could not confirm our rental until late on the day of arrival and they were flexible and understanding. "

Overall, we were happy staying at the Ballard townhouse. The location is fabulous. We were a short walk to the library and a variety of restaurants and shops. The locks and botanical garden are also a short walk away. The year-round farmer's market is fabulous. Be sure to get the doughnuts! They are the best. The location couldn't be better to access all of the fun of Ballard. 

While we were generally content with our stay, we were intially taken aback by the state of the townhouse. While it was obviously cleaned for us (baths and kitchen tidy, floors swept and vaccuumed, beds freshly made, fresh towels placed in all baths) , it looked a little ""worn"". The walls were banged up (many marks, patched but not painted in a variety of spots) and the carpet had many stains. There was only one picture hanging in the whole house with a number of empty picture hooks throughout. The house generally has the feeling that someone lived there but moved out and left a bunch of stuff behind.

There were several issues with the master bedroom. While there is an overhead ceiling fan and light, the light was not functional. There was a post-it with instructions for the overhead light but at the bottom of the note it said the light may not work so just use the lamps instead. There were two small lamps for lighting but only one lamp worked. Fortunately, the closet light worked. Another issue with the master bedroom is that one of the closet doors had fallen off and was standing in the closet. As this was a safety concern for our two-year old, we had to move the closet door to another safer location. The dressers in both bedrooms were generally not usable. The drawers were either stuck or without bottoms all together. The master closet had nice shelving that we could use and there were some hangers in the closet.

The kitchen generally had all that we needed with some searching. The kitchen cabinets were full which made it challenging for us since we were staying for two weeks and had brought a few things for our temporary home. We were able to rearrange the cupboards a bit to make space for our items. There was a vareity of items for cooking such as oil and salt and pepper which was very helpful. We were very pleased to have a washer and dryer to use.

While the Ballard townhome is in a great location, has a lovely host,  and easily accomodates a large group/family, aesthetically it could use some TLC.

And we are 1 block from 2 full grocery stores and 2 pharmacies. The Ballard locks is entertaining with a nice park. Great place to watch the salmon run if your timing is right. Shilshole and Golden Gardens are on the water and a great place to watch the sunset. They are a short drive away or a great 1.5hr round trip walk for exercise.

Pam had maps, flyers, magazines out for anything you wanted to know about the area.  Pam was so well informed and helpful for anything that was asked.

The private backyard with the covered patio was fantastic with the view of the Space Needle and the night lights were amazing.

We came to Seattle with a group of friends to celebrate the Big ""60"" birthdays. The rest of the group fell in love with the Hideaway. When the others found out their place had no backyard or no seating outside they wanted to have the celebration at the Hideaway.  Pam & Patrick graciously said we were welcomed to have the others over, and with enough seating on the patio for our group of ten, it worked out wonderfully. We had a great time.
Pam & Patrick are wonderful host and very accommodating. They are a joy to be around!!!

Don't pass up this place.  Great host, good location, and an apartment you won't want to leave. The great backyard with a wonderful covered patio with the best view of Seattle.

I would recommend the Highland Hideaway with Pam & Patrick highly.  We definitely would stay there if we have a chance to visit Seattle again.

Pam & Patrick are THE BEST!!!

I've owned this home since 1987 and have loved living on Queen Anne.  There are so many places, parks, view points to discover.  Kids playing, joggers, people walking their dogs are all a part of this very cozy neighborhood lifestyle.  Feel like going to the beach, taking a walk along the waterfront, having a drink at a popular dining establishment?  Those options are only a few minutes drive away.  
I've worked in the Seattle restaurant scene for over 20 years. There is so much going on in this city, it's crazy!  I can help guide you to any dining experience you may be looking for.  It would be a pleasure. 
During the warm summer months my outdoor deck is a fabulous place to enjoy some sun, enjoy a grilled piece of salmon on the BBQ, have a nice glass of wine and relax.  It's a wonderful escape located just a few steps away into the back yard! 
I know you'll enjoy your stay here as much as I do.

I would strongly encourage anyone or couple to stay with Jon.    He was very helpful in the beginning, when I flooded him with email upon email.  He was always quick to response and was always very friendly.  When we got there, again, he was in full party and didn't miss a beat.  Some of his guest even thought we were part of the his group, not just some random mom and her son, that is how welcoming he is.

We practice yoga and keep fit with cycling and exercising our dogs, and attempt to keep our brains working.
We are teaching ourselves to make wine and cider, and transforming our patch of land into a garden with edible and colorful characters.
We both spent our growing years traveling/moving, and currently travel every chance we can get. This means, we know how important it is to be comfortable, cozy and worry free.

I was headed out of a town and got a last-minute request to continue some work for a few more days. I emailed Jana, and she was incredibly helpful with my and her schedules. She got the room ready as soon as she could and was great about keeping me posted. When I arrived, I got right in easily. After a few minutes, Jana came down to greet me and give me the lay of the land.

To enter, you come in through the outside door and walk a few feet in to the basement, where to door to the room is. So your door isn't directly to the outside, making it a little more insulated. I liked that. The room is an eclectic room in the basement lined with bookshelves full of interesting titles surrounding a very comfortable bed. The eclectic artistic touches pop up  in the room and the attached bathroom. I thought it was great and would absolutely stay again.

The house is near the Bush School, and it's easy access to shops and close to the lake. I walked up to a nearby park and gardens, and the Madison park beach and shops are a short drive bike ride. So it's a good base for visiting. Since it is a basement apartment, you have normal basement apartment things: the ceiling is slightly lower, the windows let in less light much of the day, and you'll hear foot and paw steps up above from the pups. Usually in shorter intervals, and it didn't bother me, but worth noting if you want absolute silence. 

Jana was responsive and friendly. I met some of her friends who had stopped by when I arrived, and it's just a great group of people. I was there for only about 2 1/2 days and working much of the day, but I enjoyed my stay and am glad I got a chance to explore that part of Seattle a bit."

We have lived in Seattle for 35 years, so please think of us as your Seattle experts while you explore our city and environs.

Their home is warm and comfortable and very clean with lovely charming furnishings in a sweet Seattle neighborhood.  They know their city well and are able to guide the visitor to key eateries, museums, events and transportation.  All my needs were more than met:  yummy breakfasts (Melissa made a special effort to get  my favorite tea), lovely room and bathroom (nice clawfoot tub), engaging conversation.  There are two sitting rooms and a dining room for visiting or resting and other larger bedrooms if you have a big group and want to lodge together.
Melissa and Abil are delightful caring hosts and I would highly recommend staying with them.

I am a nationally respected director/choreographer and run an art + event space here called 10 degrees. Kirby is the owner/master distiller of a craft distillery called Oola Distillery. We have both traveled the world for our work and know first hand how a unique, comfortable and private space can make or break a journey to a new place.

Kirby and I are into contemporary visual and performance art, fine food, cocktails, wine and architecture / building. 

We are consummate hosts that value attention to detail, a clean and uncluttered atmosphere, privacy and an insiders ""road map"" to the heart of a city that can only be accessed by those who know it well. 

We have a love for personal craftsmanship and architecture and look for accommodations that are unique to each city that we travel to - (we are not fans of ye old Hampton Inn!). We like to stay in places that are well appointed and satisfyingly comfortable but also feel like a ""find"" - a place that has its own distinctive character. 

Our favorite cities aside from Seattle are Amsterdam, San Francisco, NYC (where we had an apartment for 15 years), Brussels, Paris and San Diego. We also love rural areas such as the San Juan's and Eastern Washington (Waitsburg).",within an hour,100%,100%,f,"https://a0.muscache.com/ac/users/4057441/profile_pic/1352056230/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=50:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70","https://a0.muscache.com/ac/users/4057441/profile_pic/1352056230/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=225:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70",Minor,1.0,1.0,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio']",t,t,"15th Ave, Seattle, WA 98122, United States",Minor,Minor,Central Area,Seattle,WA,98122,Seattle,"Seattle, WA",US,United States,47.60956186323319,-122.31509885196124,t,House,Entire home/apt,2,1.0,0.0,1.0,Pull-out Sofa,"{Internet,""Wireless Internet"",Kitchen,""Free Parking on Premises"",Breakfast,""Pets live on this property"",Dog(s),""Hot Tub"",Heating,Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,""Hair Dryer"",Iron}",None,$124.00,$738.00,None,None,None,1,$0.00,3,7,today,t,12,31,61,336,2016-01-04,164,2013-10-20,2016-01-02,98.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,f,None,WASHINGTON,f,strict,t,t,1,6.1,769213.0,769213.0,16537860.0,2014-07-29,6410453.0,Pinchas,"My wife and I stayed at this wonderful private garden apartment  in the very heart of Capital Hill. The apartment is small and only relevant for a couple. The apartment was very clean and the fold-up couch bed  surprisingly comfortable. The garden and porch where a pleasure and I enjoyed reading in the lush quite garden. We appreciated the fresh eggs from their chickens and the cold water, muffins and butter waiting for us in the fridge. We did not use the soaking tub but it looks great and relaxing.
It was also a pleasure to meet KT and her husband Kirby. They were both very kind and wanted to make sure that we were settled and comfortable.
About the area: Capital Hill is the heart of funky Seattle. A very eclectic group of people live in the area adding a lot of color to the rolling hills  of the city. What we loved about the apartment is its close proximity to  this area and a mere 30 minute, down hill walk to Pike's Market Place (take the bus back and you can pay on the bus). Also, the apartment is only a 10 minute walk to a lovely park complete with a historic  water tower that you can climb for the view, a pond and a botanical garden ($4.00 per person fee). There are even some shady walking paths with splendid views of the city below.
Finally, Kirby is a proud owner-distiller of Oola distillery where he creates various prize winning vodkas and whiskeys. On Saturday a free tasting tour is offered and should not be missed(book before and it's only a one minute walk from the apartment). His products are top notch and made with such care and affinity for perfection.
We highly recommend this apartment and the surrounding area.  "

The townhouse was nice with hardwood throughout. The hardwood gave the townhouse a very sturdy and grounding atmosphere. Having a second bathroom made the stay for our group of four much easier, as my brother loves to spend time primping in the bathroom. Although the area surrounding didn't have a large amount of options, there are a couple of nice coffee shops within a block or two. Also, the International District is a short drive and has plenty of mind blowing options (stick to the strip malls to avoid the more Americanized options). 
Unfortunately, we were there during an unseasonably hot July, the townhouse does not have a/c, and the series of fans was not enough to keep us cool. However, I lived in Seattle for about a decade and never had a/c in an apartment, normally you don't need it but 1-2 weeks out of the year (if that).
Finally, Chris showed alacrity for dealing with problems when the water throughout the townhouse turned brown one morning from some nearby construction. Chris made all the necessary calls (to the city no less) and gave us a timeline when we could expect it to get better. He is very good at communicating. 
I am tempted to take off a star for the lack of a/c, but since that amenity is so unusual in Seattle, it would not be fair."

It is perfect for a group of friends who want to go to Belltown or Lower Queen Anne.  We were disappointed by the cleanliness. The bathroom and kitchen could really use a deep clean (tub and toilet were stained and the mirror and sink weren't super clean). I think the problem was that we booked last minute (the night before we checked in), so it may not have been enough time for Matt to really do a deep clean.  Besides the cleanliness it's an older building and there isn't much that Matt can do about it, but the carpet really needs to be replaced and the entire apartment could use a really good scrub, especially the bathroom.  Overall, I thought $199/nt + fees and taxes was too expensive for the apartment.

To explore Seattle's other neighborhoods – Ballard, Capital Hill, Fremont, Madison Park and more – try Uber or (website hidden) any of these options:  • South Lake Union Streetcar (2 blocks away)  • Pronto Cycle Share (around the corner)  • Trip planning, King Country Metro (bus stops nearby) If you want to explore outside the city, Avis, Hertz, Enterprise and Budget all have offices within walking distance.

John works with a property management group and both parties were super responsive. There was a mishap with the heater my first night and John brought over an electric heater the next day.

we’re Leah and Kyle. 

Leah is a video game artist. She also designs and creates a lot of the things you’ll see in her apartment. You will most likely be able to get her to hang out if you invite her to grab some sushi someplace. 

kyle is a huge comic book fan and can talk about his favorite writers and artists for ages. He works in the videogame industry and has been credited in a bunch of games. Here’s a few of them.
Halo5, Batman: Arkham City, F3AR 3, Mortal Kombat (2011), Lollipop Chainsaw. 

We both have apartments in downtown Seattle that are very close to Pike Market and share them on Airbnb to help with the increasing costs of living in the city and also as a way of making new friends. We help each other out, combining our local knowledge of the area and provide quicker responses. Kyle’s lived in the city for ages and knows a lot about downtown and Leah’s new to the area and has a fresh perspective on everything.

They went to work on it, remodeling every apartment, putting in new plumbing and electrical, and making it modern in almost all conveniences (no dishwashers or elevator.)  Mark did most of the work himself.  We now have several short term apartments and 17 long term apartments.  It's a great building.  They live in the country, 30 miles from St. John's, and when one of their short terms is open they stay in them. I'm sure you'll love it too!

A little bit about me: Mark and Oda hired me to manage their short term rental units, and help out as their personal assistant for whatever else! I help them throw big parties in their country home, do renovations on their barn, and entertain them with terrible jokes. I'm a big art nerd and have converted the basement of St. John's into my studio space. I love to travel - but hate feeling touristy, so I love AirBnB's people-to-people way of seeing the world. My style of hosting is mostly just let you do your thing, but I love when people drop in my office for a chat and I'm always happy to dole out some advice on Seattle! I was born and raised in this city so I know it pretty well by now, despite a decade of living elsewhere in my short life. I wrote the neighborhood guide in the guest handbook in each unit, so you can also read about some of my favorite spots in there!

Christine was so nice and accessible for any questions my group and I had during our stay. The rooms were comfortable and the apartment was very clean. The location is in the heart of Capitol Hill and there is a 24 hour grocery store across the street! Starbucks is nearby as well. We really enjoyed the neighborhood and could easily walk downtown.

It's right in the heart of Pioneer Square, which is one of my favorite areas - close to touristy Pike's Market, but also within easy walking distance to all the amazing restaurants in International Village (I highly recommend Jade Garden!) Our only inconvenience was the other airbnb guests staying in the unit below us. They decided to have an insanely loud 25-person party in their room starting from about 8pm Saturday night until about 4am. It was a huge nightmare as we came back to the apt early that night because I was wiped out and needed sleep. I know Darcy did her best to get them to stop (including calling the police), and apparently they did a number on the room before finally getting out of there. Those rude guests aside, I would definitely recommend this place as it seems like that group was an unfortunate one-off."

We arrived late Thursday night after cooking and eating dinner at my home.  We spent the next day just hanging out all day long in the house with 3 additional family members.  There was plenty of space for rest, reading, conversation, eating, and even doing some homework.  We especially loved the large living /dining room area, and the the separate sitting areas off of the main bedroom as well as in the entryway. We also really appreciated 1 and a quarter bathrooms. The house is decorated tastefully and definitely has good energy.  On Saturday we ventured out and enjoyed walking along Alki Beach; just a block away. Some of my group sat outside for a bit on the front porch with a view of the water. West Seattle is a great location because it has a feeling of being slightly removed from the mainland yet all of Seattle is literally a hop, skip, and a jump away. Saturday night we drove to Pike Place Market; also just a 10 or 15 minute drive.  Sandra was extremely friendly, welcoming, and responsive to all of my questions and needs.  I asked for a DVD player before we arrived and she provided that on schedule.  We had a fabulous time.  I highly recommend Sandra's place.  It was the perfect stay-cation for my family."

We sat and people watched from the window for awhile. There's a small square in view and we saw several groups from the underground tour walk by to see the oldest restaurant in Seattle. 

I would say the only con was finding a place to park our rental car. We ended up paying $28 for the Butler parking garage very close to the apartment. Which worked out just fine, we just weren't accustomed to city parking! We made sure to not leave any items in our car and had no troubles to report. 
 
The bartenders of Merchants, Hannah and Justin, were extremely helpful in checking in and answering any questions we had. We did not go out for drinks when we stayed here because we didn't want to walk home through the surrounding area alone. We did however have a drink at Merchants and had a nice time."

Cody is a pleasant, capable host who has provided a really comfortable, good value place for this weary traveler. I hope to return soon and get to know him better.

My 5 night stay with Cody was really, really good for me. His place is  very comfortable. A large, quiet bedroom with nice furnishings. I had plenty of floor space to dismantle my suitcase, find my travel gifts and then regroup. Additionally 4  pillows and a really good  bedside lamp allowed me to prop myself up and read on and off throughout the night. My slightly ill body was on a 9 hour difference sleeping schedule and kept waking up. I was waiting for the dawn while attempting to fall back to sleep. Cody was sleeping two floors up stairs. I was thankful that the arrangement provided enough separating distance, so I did not feel like I might be bothering him in the middle of the night. I also had a totally clean separate private bathroom and easy, no stairs, access directly from the parking area. What more could a girl want!!!!!!

The location is great for bus riders. The off street alley access was a little tricky to find at first but Cody gave me good instructions and 4 friends  and a shuttle  driver found it easily. I was also happy to have Chuck's Hop Shop with its interesting assortment of food trucks and inside/outside tables right next door.  

One really, really, really nice bonus.... Cody plays guitar really, really well. On Saturday and Sunday as he relaxed during the day, he played. I had two wonderful concerts while sitting, propped up snug and warm in the bed, reading...... the music filled the air. DELIGHTFUL!!!!!!

My only want .... No big deal!!!!! was a glass in the bathroom. I was trying to drink extra water because of my cold and taking a couple of medicines. If I had asked, I am certain Cody would have helped me.

Best wishes Cody!!!  NICE PHOTO And Thank you very much!! If you ever want to visit Montana... Mi Casa Es Su Casa, Siempre!!!!"

I would definitely recommend bringing your own pillow(s) and blanket(s). Skyler will give you a key to his apartment so you can come and go as you please. One additional note, Skyler and his roomate John both smoke cannibis in the apartment but they are perfectly willing to accomadate you and smoke outside or in their friends apartment above them.  If you're looking for a laid-back atmosphere and don't mind crashing on a couch or air matteress, this is the place for you!"

The location was perfect, close to Seattle University, and within very close walking distance to restaurant, coffee shops, grocery stores and multiple parks. The fact that it came with a reserved, off the street parking space was essential and very handy. The place is accurately depicted in the photos. Lots of modern fixtures and amenities. Mostly it is decorated by Ikea, which keeps it functional and fun. The kitchen is well stocked. I really appreciated the small things like the fact that the coffee pot had filters in the cabinet so I didn't have to buy them. Although there is not a dining room table, we took to eating at the long bistro counter. Joe keeps it in line with Seattle's sustainability focus, by providing an easy way to compost and recycle. He also has one of those moder toilets that flushes two ways ( one way to conserve water). There were two bikes (and helmets and locks) that we could use so that was fun also! The front yard provides a patch of grass that was great to relax on in the evening. This place was super kid/ child friendly! There was a pack and play in the unit and an umbrella stroller. It took me only about 5 minutes to baby proof the house by moving vases up higher, altering locations of lamps and cords. The bathtub is great-- we used it for bathing our child every day. The shower head is heavenly! The place is kept shoes free, which is very helpful when you have a little one like ours that will put dirt/ twigs/ other shoe-tracked-in things in his mouth. The electronics worked great. The fans came in handy, since it was very hot when we were there. The bed in the bedroom was comfortable with lots of great feathery pillows. The only downside was the couch-hide-a-bed in the living room. Like all hide-a-beds, is was a back breaker! Joe opts for the stricter cancellation policy, which is cool. AirBnB/VRBO set this up so the others who are upset, should be mad at the sites, not owner. The upstairs is a vacation rental, and we met 2 different groups that stayed there. They seemed really nice, and the place is really well built that you can't hear them walking around or anything. There is a cool notebook in the place with photos of the original house before it was remodeled which I appreciated looking at. I also really appreciated the Grocery store QFC rewards card on the key chain. It gave us like $20 in discounts. Definitely go to the one on Broadway and not the one on 15th. I also highly recommend getting some coffee and wood fired bagels from the close by restaurant Eltana. Yum! All in all I have to say this is a great place, for a great price! Definitely would stay here..."

A true Seattleite, I love coffee, books, and a good craft cocktail. When you confirm a reservation with me, I'll send you a link to my personal website that lists dozens of bars, indie restaurants, and off-the-beaten-path places to give you a local's insight to the city.

A true Seattleite, I love coffee, books, and a good craft cocktail. When you confirm a reservation with me, I'll send you a link to my personal website that lists dozens of bars, indie restaurants, and off-the-beaten-path places to give you a local's insight to the city. The hotlinks embedded in the page will allow you to research menus and details in advance of your stay. I update my list all the time. My guests thank me, but my liver hates me. =)

We are avid Airbnb guests as well as hosts. We first stayed at an Airbnb location in Sydney, Australia, while honeymooning in January 2012, and were so impressed with our experience that we are now hooked! Not only are the Airbnb properties a good value, but more importantly, we have had amazing interactions with each of the hosts at locations where we've stayed, which now have expanded beyond Sydney, AU, to include a few locations in our home state of Washington as well as cities such as Vancouver, Canada,  Portland and Bend in Oregon, San Francisco and Sonora, CA, Baltimore, Miami, and New York City and Ithaca, NY, and London, Cornwall and Bath in the United Kingdom. We've been a guest in 21 different Airbnb locations over the past 3-1/2 years. In fact, I can't remember the last time we stayed at a conventional hotel!

Since we had such great experiences as guests, we decided to start hosting in the summer of 2012 and listed our guest room on Airbnb. Hosting has proven to be a fantastic experience since we are both seasoned travelers and enjoy chatting with others about their travels, etc.

In terms of demographics, we are both in our mid-forties, have traveled all around the country (and the world) and are also are very tidy and respectful. Beyond travelling, we like listening to live music, exploring neighborhoods, having fun with our dogs, gardening and cooking great food, spending time near the water/beach, and meeting new people.",within a few hours,100%,100%,t,"https://a0.muscache.com/ac/users/468703/profile_pic/1310432179/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=50:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70","https://a0.muscache.com/ac/users/468703/profile_pic/1310432179/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=225:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70",Ballard,2.0,2.0,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'kba']",t,t,"18th Ave NW, Seattle, WA 98117, United States",Ballard,Loyal Heights,Ballard,Seattle,WA,98117,Seattle,"Seattle, WA",US,United States,47.682309277976834,-122.37874966188296,t,House,Private room,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,Real Bed,"{TV,Internet,""Wireless Internet"",Kitchen,""Free Parking on Premises"",""Pets live on this property"",Dog(s),""Indoor Fireplace"",Heating,""Family/Kid Friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke Detector"",""Carbon Monoxide Detector"",""First Aid Kit"",""Safety Card"",""Fire Extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo}",183.0,$90.00,$567.00,None,$150.00,None,2,$15.00,1,365,3 weeks ago,t,30,56,84,173,2016-01-04,115,2012-06-18,2015-10-17,95.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,f,None,WASHINGTON,f,moderate,f,t,2,2.66,218741.0,218741.0,9279363.0,2013-12-17,10568046.0,Cary,"Corinne & Tom were wonderful hosts and made my first airbnb experience a pleasurable one.

I also lived in Washington DC for around 4 years.  This means that I'm an avid Cubs and Bears fan, but love the Washington Capitols, and am becoming a big Seattle Sounders fan as well.  

So, with being from the Midwest, trekking to the East coast, and now living on the far west coast, I have friends and family all across the country.  I travel to see the people whom I miss and care about deeply, as well as continue to see cities and areas in the US, and all over the world as well.

How do I travel and see an area?  Through food and conversation!  I love to experience a new area through the eyes and tastes of those who live in a city. I ask the locals where to get coffee and if they had only one last place to eat at in the city, where they would go.  I adore farmers markets and local shows and (website hidden), good wine, lots of sunlight, and hitting the road with my running shoes are all things I love in life.  I'm looking forward to using Airbnb on many of my future trips.  I've stayed in hotels and many bed and breakfasts on my travels.  But, sometimes I like to hit that farmers market, grab great food and whip up a great meal with wine I've snagged along the way.  Or, if I'm visiting one of my old homes, I want a place where I can ask my family to come over to talk and catch up versus always having to head out on the town.

Favorite places so far I've visited: Ireland - great scotch!  Italy - Way too many amazing qualities to list. Austin - Wonderful live music. DC - history, politics, food, hiking, and again too many to list.

She was very informative before our trip, was able to accommodate her schedule to receive us (even though we arrived later than expected), and was understanding and helpful at the end of the trip so we could make a late check-out.

Also, she takes very good care of her apartment and she expects her guests to be thoughtful and considerate with her space. This helps in keeping the apartment in perfect condition for each new group of guests. We loved staying here because it felt just like home. Clean. Warm. Authentic.

Additionally, the place has a magnificent location. It's very close to the Seattle Center—and its impressive Space Needle—and at walking distance from downtown. Also, you can find dozens of good restaurants and inspiring coffee places in the area.

Staying here was the best decision we could make to fully enjoy this city full of wonders."

As a host: Think Singapore airlines first-class, not a Delta red-eye the night before Thanksgiving. I believe in treating people with the utmost care and respect. When you stay at my home, I want you to feel like it's your home. Kick back and relax. If you need a pointer or 2, feel free to ask. I speak French, Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish and am learning Arabic right now. I grew up in a French province and used to bartend so I can probably pick you out a drink if you're in need of libation. I'm also a foodie that both eats out a lot as well as cooks; I can certainly appreciate a judiciously prepared bite and LOVE LOVE LOVE to help people find a satisfying meal. Random jobs I've held the past of note: stunt woman, bouncer, door-to-door sales, microbiologist, human/bovine tissue engineer. Right now, I'm a software architect. My husband also works in software and we have a 1 year daughter who loves to wriggle and play. He speaks Arabic, French and German. She speaks to turtles, pandas and coffee mugs.

As a guest: I've traveled to 3 continents and 9 countries so far. I like to pack as light as possible (backpack preferred). I'm not afraid to drive stick (even when it's been a decade since I've last tried). Ordering off menu is always a fun adventure. I also try to avoid tourist areas and go after secretly coveted local places that only natives enjoy. I've never joined a curated tour group and I hope I never do. I've pet tigers in Chiang Mai, bathed with Yakuza in Tokyo, eaten scorpions in Beijing, shot snake vodka in Taipei, swam with jellyfish in Valencia, was marooned in both Paris and Madrid, witnessed the entire starry universe in a town just outside of Stuttgart... the list just goes on. My next trip is to the French/Italian Riviera for some serious R&R.

1. Location. It was a 30 min drive from the airport, 15 min from downtown, and 15 min from engagement party. For us this was a perfect blend.
2. Kids/infant friendly. I was traveling with a 6 month old infant and I needed a full working fridge/freezer. Also, the host provided us with pack and play that we used. This was handy and a nice touch 
3. Spacious/roomy. The place is quite big. The bedrooms are spacious so you dont feel like you are top of anyone. And with the baby, it helps to have lots of room. 
4. Clean. I am big on cleaning. Even if I go to a hotel room, I inspect the bed, pillows, sheets. So I was happy to see everything was at a high standard. 
5. The little things. I was pleasantly surprised to see a makeup table and mirror in each room and long mirrors as well. I also loved the games and movies provided. 

Overall it was a great experience. I don't have any complaints.

(New pillows for each and every guest.  They're yours to take at the end of your visit.) What's up with the free pillows?  Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration.

She was kind enough to welcome practically my whole family--two parents (including myself) and a baby in the Golden Sun room, two grandparents in the Toulouse Lautrec room, and an uncle in the calm green room. The Golden Sun room's side room was a nice place to gather, with two comfy chairs, a small fridge, and toaster oven. It was also easy to make some coffee in the communal kitchen. The shared bathroom never posed a problem; there is actually a second, smaller bathroom besides the Barry White bathroom, and at least one was always available. We stayed over the second weekend of a month, which means we got to enjoy the Georgetown Art Attack, a neighborhood gallery walk with a central corridor right around this AirBnB location, plus a couple of other locations (Equinox Studios and Studio E) reachable by the frequent shuttle service. Get started early on the Art Attack. There's lots to see. End your night right downstairs at the Trailer Park Mall, where, when we visited, a singer and guitarist were playing some gypsy/cabaret/jazz/bossa music. They stayed open later than the rest of the walk. The next day was also the Georgetown Garden Walk, where the neighbors and parks show off their gardens and backyards and produce. The host Angielena was working at the Urban Farm and Food Forest, a new enterprise on the southern edge of the walk. There's lots of good food, beer, bars, and coffee around. Some spots had irregular hours, but we were never left without options. There's also the Carleton Avenue Grocery (the oldest in the state, with friendly owners, and astrong wine selection, especially for a corner market) ~10 min walk away. If you're staying at the Georgetown Art Center, you're probably also interested in visiting downtown Seattle. Luckily, the bus stops right in front of this location, and can get you downtown in about ~15 minutes (though we found the wait on the return trips to be a little slow. Try to time the return). A smaller group could make good use of Uber. The only real drawback I'd point out is that there's a county airport just to the south (not SeaTac, King County). Most of the planes that fly over are small jets and little private planes, but there were a couple freight planes that were fairly jolting. This was most noticeable in the Golden Sun room; my parents in the Toulouse Lautrec room didn't notice it as much. So, yes, we had a terrific time staying here and exploring Georgetown. It's different from probably anywhere you've stayed. The doors that don't lead to AirBnB rooms lead to private art studios. There's a Trailer Park shopping mall, a bar, and a cafe downstairs. The only comparison I can make is to the famed McMenamins properties of Oregon and Washington, where they've taken historical buildings and turned them into lodging (and dining and drinking) establishments, like Edgefield.

PROS: The view, spacious kitchen, spacious living room, the feeling that you are living with a family that cares and not just a group of travelers (which it also is! and oh how many stories they all have!), the laundry (detergent provided), the effective heating system, comfortable beds,  separate common space that is a bit quieter and great for studying, the garage where you can keep your bike safe, the VIEW, staff (so friendly and so thoughtful!) the weekly get-togethers of past and present guests, scented candles in the bathroom (there are 3 bathrooms), how clean everything is kept, and the locks for valuables.

CONS: Many windows are sealed shut (no ventilation in the bunk room) and the shower drain needs to be unclogged (but water runs strong though!).

As we opened the gate, we were greeted with a can of raid insect repellent. This was disconcerting. While we found the overall cleanliness acceptable - esp the bathroom- we discovered why an insect repellent was needed.  There were many crumbs under the sink and surrounding the garbage pail. Luckily, the co-op had natural wipes so we thoroughly cleaned it. 

The location was excellent: walking distance to the an organic grocer (an amazing co-op), Trader Joe’s, an organic juice bar, and to the heart of Capitol Hill’s night life and restaurants.  If you come with a car, parking will run about $20 per day, in a open air parking lot about 3 blocks away.  The downside of this parking lot is that you have to activate it with your app at 6 am, as the night payment only applies till 6 am in the morning.

However, due to the heat, we had to open the windows and were subjected to the street noise (buses, cars and rowdy folks), fumes and dust from living on the ground floor. We had no choice but to leave those windows open. As well, a bedroom fan had to be on constantly, which was unsettling during the sleeping hours.  There is no cross ventilation in this apartment. None of this was not disclosed in advance.  


Be forewarned; At&t service doesn’t work inside the apartment; wifi is fine. Apple tv was a plus. We appreciated the (clean) hardwood floors.

No one meets you to give you the keys.  You must go around the corner to a group of lock boxes with a combination.  If you arrive late, this is very inconvenient.  Also, there was only one set for the two of us - even more inconvenient.

If you come with a car, parking will run about $20 per day, in a open air parking lot about 3 blocks away.

There were 4 bath towels for two of us - plenty - yet no hand towels, wash cloths or hair dryer - essential for travelers.  The kitchen was decent regardless of an  electric stove and teflon cookware.  The main compartment of the frig was clean, the door - holding condiments - was not.

We left one of our keys behind, and contacted the “pillow team”, who were prompt in responding. We found it surprisingly unacceptable that they were going to charge us $15 plus shipping to return it.

I run arts & culture nonprofit venues here in Seattle and consult on venue designs/remodels in other cities with my Lonely Buildings project.  Mature, quiet, professional, very active and not home all that often really.  I love good local food and can give you lots of great recommendations for healthy options, and of course the best local coffee and beer.  I (almost) always know where the good concerts and shows are, sometimes free ones too!   I play a lot of volleyball at the beach or park and paddleboard often as well. Maybe I'll take you out on the water if interested! 

Check out my venues by searching ""Fremont Abbey"" or ""Ballard Homestead"" for concert listings.

My housemates and I love sharing the house with people from near or far who have a positive outlook on life and who can respect the space and understand it's a real home not a fancy B&B or hotel. 
  
Though we're not around much, sometimes great conversations do spring up in the evening if the schedules align so that's always fun. Generally it's a pretty quiet house for resting and relaxing. 

Our rooms won't always be available as we typically have long term housemates, but just depends on the time of year and our vacations.

I love to travel and have been so far to Iceland, Copenhagen, Berlin, Haiti, New Zealand, Australia, Honduras, Mexico, Scotland, Ireland, England, Canada, NYC, Austin, California, etc. 

I love hot sauces and fun interesting foods, talking about social change, neuroscience & psychology, etc. 

Paddleboarding and beach volleyball are pretty much my favorite activities these days but hiking, backpacking and sailing are awesome too.

We only had a short time to do some sight seeing since we were there to play a tennis tournament; we were at the club all day most days. Paul worked around our schedule and I'm sure we saw more of the city than we ever could on our own or even with a professional tour guide. The house had every amenity we needed, very clean and well stocked with household items.  The neighborhood was safe, parking a little tricky but we managed. House had 4 bedrooms that were rented and even showering and toilet time worked out for everyone. Had it been hot at night it could have been unpleasant since there is no a/c but there were a couple fans we used even at that. I would definitely stay again in the future especially since it was so convenient to the club where we  played."

But let me tell you, I was still unprepared for the entirety of the experience of being welcomed into their home, and into their lives. Almost immediately I felt that I was participating as a member of their household, which as a solo traveler is a priceless commodity. I noticed that some of their other guests took little advantage of the social aspects of a true bed-and-breakfast and utilized their room as if they were in a motel, what a shame. The house, which is a grand old Victorian, is beautifully decorated and furnished in period pieces. Everything is scrupulously clean and well attended to, each and every day. Melissa bakes a different muffin each morning inspired by what fresh fruits/nuts/grains are available locally and I can’t remember when I’ve had better. Abil was a font of advice of where to go and what to see.All of my days were capped off with conversations with the hosts or other guests, getting advice for more activities and places to see, and of course hanging out in the potting shed to sample some of the beer Abil brings home from Pike brewing. Did I forget to mention El Gatto? Well you’ll have to visit to meet him. Let’s not forget Courtney, who’s knowledge and help with the local transit made my travel within Seattle so much easier. Well just in case it’s not obvious, I really enjoyed my stay here and hope to visit again!

Before our arrival she was great with the communication. Upon our arrival, she was extremely friendly, welcoming, and accommodating - she had homemade chocolates waiting for us in our room, and offered to drive us into the city when we wanted to go grab lunch so we didn't have to pay for an Uber. After we had lunch we came back to her home to fresh-baked cookies. After that, we ended up spending the next couple hours just hanging out with Mar in which she drove us around the lake, showed us some Seattle landmarks, and ended up dropping us off right where we needed to go. We had great conversation and Mar aided it making the trip one to remember! 

Couples things to note for future guests:
1) This is definitely a ""shared economy"" experience. Mar puts several of her rooms on Airbnb at a time so you could have others also staying in the place at the same time you do. 
2) That being said, because it is a shared household, guests should not expect ""hotel-like"" neatness in the common areas. 
3) The mattress in the room that I stayed in wasn't super comfortable for me, but that is person-specific and definitely not the worst thing I've slept on. Just a little thinner than I prefer. 
These things didn't bother us whatsoever, but just something to know. 

Overall, the stay was amazing and I would definitely recommend Mar's Airbnb listings. "

Ian is happy to answer all questions prior to my arrival (please give him at least 1-2 days to respond).  He is super-accommodating with towels, soaps, and linens; he and his girlfriend will even check your space while you're away (just like hotel service; if you prefer more privacy, though, just ask) to restock toilet paper and so forth.  They're constantly working to improve the space (a real mattress instead of an airbed), which is already far better than I'd imagine it would be.  And they're CLEAN ... even though they have a dog (awesome pet) on premises and I'm very sensitive to pet dander, I experienced zero issues during my entire stay.  Very thoughtful host.

Remember: Please be respectful of the house and the hosts and their rules (Ian didn't have many, though, since he's very easygoing), as always, and you'll have no problems here!

LOCATION:  Awesome!  It's between Sea-Tac airport and downtown Seattle, so you won't have to go as far as other places to find it.  And if you're renting a car and plan to explore other parts of Washington (such as the Cascades or Mount Rainier) besides the city of Seattle, this West Seattle neighborhood is ideal!  Plenty of free parking on the street, access to stores and late night places (most of Seattle closes down early, I've learned), cheaper gas stations ... you won't ever feel gouged compared to if you're staying near downtown.  That said, I can be over the bridge and at Seattle Center, Pike Place, Chinatown or any of the other major tourist spots within 10-15 minutes (at least, outside of the work rush hour).  Parking downtown may take you a little more time, but that has nothing to do with this location.

Many thanks to Ian and his household for making my first AirBnB experience in Seattle an top-notch one!"

I lived on Capitol Hill in a condo until moving to this house on North Beacon Hill in 2002.  This neighborhood is RELATIVELY close to downtown (but not IN downtown) and convenient for AirBnB guests with vehicle who are looking for a compromise between hostel and motel or else don't mind riding public transit or using UberX and Lyft to visit all the major tourist sights.

I spend most of my time reading or on my computer in my office. I am a self-employed property manager who lives/works from home so talking to guests who visit is a refreshing break from a mostly solitary life.  I have a degree in English literature and traveled widely before settling down and ""getting married"" to my house.  I am happy to rent extra space in my home out as long as you are a clean, quiet, self-sufficient and low-maintenance guest.  Please note AirBnB does not do criminal background checks so when I get a request I WILL look your name up on the internet to see if you appear to have a ""safe"" profile.  Please make sure your booking request includes the information I request for best results. I started hosting people in July 2014.  As a host I need guests to make sure they understand what they are getting. I don't want a guest who doesn't bother to read my listing, then gives me less than 5 stars for things they should've expected before arriving (such as LOCATION - how does a host fix their Location? It's on the map!) or Value (did you not search other listings first? If you want Value join the homeless and go pitch a tent downtown! They have a better location, no house rules, and don't have to recycle!) If you don't understand the cost of owning real estate  in Seattle with its property taxes, sales taxes, cost of utilities and insurance rates, then don't review me on your assumptions of what you think the room price should be here without doing some comparison shopping first. We're not in Kansas anymore, Toto!  Bottom line: I offer cheap room rentals for short-stay travelers as long as they are well-behaved guests. If you are looking for hotel quality accommodations at this price on Airbnb - you're just NOT going to find it unless you pay hotel quality prices or stay in a place much further out from downtown.

If you are new to AirBnB please look up the internet article:
Read These Tips, or Nobody Will Ever Let You Be an Airbnb Guest Again.  

If you are considering becoming a host yourself, I recommend looking up AirBnB Horror Stories and AirbnB Rental Nightmares to understand the risk and liability involved in being one.

We stayed in Tom's place and words cannot express how comfortable we were.  The apartment has no surprises. The pictures are exactly what you will find. The entrance is private, attached near the main home. We felt safe and at home. The kitchenette is perfect but sadly we were out and about so often we only used the area once for cooking.  There are coffee pots, microwave, regular size fridge, lots of extras in the cabinet (coffee, tea, and some household ingredients. {oil, seasonings, etc} ).  We were a 1.3 mile walk to a local Catholic church, and great cafe's.  If you get a chance visit Columbia City Bakery for a delicious pastry and superb coffee. Our walk was along a busy street but we felt safe the entire distance.  Lots of bus stops along the way and also the Lite Rail is a short distance from the apartment. The weather for us was a treat. We did have a bit of rain the first two mornings but otherwise the temps were 70-80's and sunny. The drive to downtown Seattle is quick (15 miles ). Our daughter took us around to see the sights. A must for all travelers is a visit to Pike Market. We visited a Farmer's Market in Magnolia, rode the Ferris Wheel, drove 2 hours south to visit Mnt. Rainier, and many other adventures too numerous to list. We were first time customers of AirBnB and will do it again and again. My husband has already asked me "" When are we going back to rent Tom's place again ?""  Sadly we never did meet Tom in person but we did meet his wife Marina one morning. Thanks again for the great, homey apartment.  Valerie in Pennsylvania "

My husband and I really enjoy traveling. We have been to Vietnam, Guatemala, China, Hong Kong, Bali, and several other islands in Indonesia. We have also been to many countries in Europe as well. 

We really enjoy having international friends and learning about different cultures. We bike a lot. One year we rode our bikes from Lyon to Perpignan (750 km within France). That was a wonderful experience and hope to do an other bike trip soon. 

We also really enjoy working on and doing renovations on our home.

When I arrived, she was home to orient me to the house. Her older home was not only beautiful but it was also immaculate. 

Although the bedroom is small, the bed is comfortable and the sheets were luxurious. The closet and bureau drawers had ample room to stow my belongings during my stay. The two guest rooms share a wall, and, because noises travels, I was appreciative that the other guest didn’t snore. The shared modern bathroom is convenient to the bedrooms. It is spacious, features thoughtful details, and as immaculate as the rest of the house. Ourania helps guests set designated shower time to get everyone in the household gracefully through morning preparations.

Ourania’s older cat Diva learned that I had a welcoming lap and adopted me quickly, following me upstairs to my bedroom. One has to be quick to shut the bedroom door, as the house rule is “no cats in the bedrooms”. Good rule. 

 Ourania is not only kind, but she is also generous. She clearly wants to make her guests comfortable. She installed a night light in the bathroom for guests that have need of the bathroom at night. She loaned me an umbrella and procured a lightweight blanket for my comfort because the weather was unpredictable. 

I wish I had had more time to visit with Ourania. Next time!

We ended up renting bikes to use for the weeking (company= peddle anywhere) and that worked out extremely well.  Aaron's place has character and he keeps it relatively clean.  It was a very comfortable home base.  We had plenty of space for all of our stuff, and he had everything laid out for us, and we were welcome to use any household items if we wished- it truly was like visiting a friend in the city.  He provided information and suggestions about the city, fresh towels and linens, washer detergent and dryer sheets... all the details which make staying somewhere enjoyable.  His directions for arrival, stay and departure were clear and easy to follow.  He was easy to contact (I spoke with before visitng and during my stay).

It was spacious, very clean, and cozy and a great place to land after a couple days in Olympic National Park. The pictures don't do it justice. The neighborhood was convenient (we had a rental car so I'm not sure about public transportation options) and quiet. Kay was very responsive and although we didn't have a chance to meet her, she provided helpful tips for our visit to the area and to Olympic National Park during our pre-trip communications. The bed was comfortable, fluffy bedding & towels, lots of space heaters around to take any chill out of the air (usually only had to turn one on for a short while), nice lighting throughout the retreat, plenty of space to store your luggage and belongings, large full-power microwave, etc. Many nice little touches and thoughtful instructions/suggestions. Yes, you do hear some footsteps and normal living sounds sometimes from upstairs, but this is expected in a basement apartment and was not an issue; made it feel even cosier, in my opinion. Kay & her daughter make an effort to keep noise down and, in fact, ask you to put a pinwheel outside the door in the garden when you leave for your day's explorations so they can do any loud household chores upstairs while you are out. Very considerate! I'm a cat lover and wish I had met the handsome grey cat who lives upstairs & who is mentioned in some of these reviews; I did see him sunning himself on the front porch. Another time, perhaps! The Wedgewood Retreat is a fantastic value for the price. I would not hesitate to stay here again and recommend it to family, friends, and fellow airbnb-ers. "

And her home is perfectly located.  It represents great value and is one of few rentals available in that wonderful corner of Seattle.

I would particularly recommend this property for those who are sound sleepers and generally not disturbed by noise.  For me, though, the match was not a perfect one.  I was surprised that when I checked in, Laurie had left a rental agreement to sign with a clause to the effect of ""Renter acknowledges that this is a basement unit in an inhabited house and hence that footsteps and other household noise are audible.""  Of course, I went ahead and signed because there was no other choice at that point-- I'd already arrived and checked in.  However, the noise mentioned was, as the rental agreement noted, very typical for an older home but also very present.  I could hear continuous footsteps during waking hours, full conversations, even the sound of someone mixing ingredients in a bowl in the kitchen.  For me, the very audible presence of the host (who I do not fault at all) just living her life distracted from my stay.  

My only suggestion for Laurie would be to more clearly highlight this clause from the rental agreement on the Airbnb listing, so that potential renters can make the decision to come stay ""eyes wide open"".  For someone who is used to sharing a living space with others and/or not troubled by normal household noises, then this property is a wonderful place to stay, and I highly recommend it!

Special thanks to Laurie for: 1) the timely communication throughout the booking process and stay, 2) being so impressively organized, and 3) the small touches like fresh cherries in the fridge and baked goods offered.

For the right guests, this property is a gem that represents great value, an enviable location, and an ultra professional host!

Thanks Laurie!"

Wanted to be as descriptive as possible so that prospective guests would know what to expect from a ""guest's"" perspective.)
This last weekend did not disappoint!  We really love Errin's place.  
The privacy is wonderful--we were only a short walk from our kid's place and being able to park the vehicle and walk back and forth was great.  If one wants to venture further--without a vehicle--the bus line is only steps away. The Seattle bus system is very efficient, in my opinion.  We've ridden it all over the city--to the downtown--and even used it to catch the commuter train to the airport.

My daughter, wife and I all loved watching the seaplanes take off from Lake Union.  The location is good.  The building is right on two bus lines (the 26 and 28), and a few blocks away from another line (the 5).  Also, it's not too far to walk down to Lake Union, maybe 15 minutes, or even down to Seattle Center, maybe 30.  Not far from funky Fremont, either.  Lots of blackberries in the neighbor for kids to munch on, too, (at least in August when we visited). 

This is a great space that was perfect for our family's six-day visit to Seattle. Luxury-seekers take note, this apartment is not the Ritz.  It has wall to wall carpet and has comfy couches and beds, and a great living room/dining room with a table and chairs that seats four.  Two bathrooms and a kitchen with a good-size fridge for cooking, and plenty -- plenty! -- of living space.  Also has a long hallway, which lets different family members be in different parts of the house. Washer and dryer work great.  We were very comfortable.

Louise was a great host.  Her brother Rory was there to meet us when we arrived, and he showed us around, gave us keys, etc.  Louise contacted us to make sure all was well during our stay.
This is an excellent value, especially in a city as expensive as Seattle, and I'd happily stay there again. "

It was a perfect home base for us. Before we had arrived I thought that things were much farther apart, but I was surprised to see how close we were to everything! We had rented a car so it was a very easy trip to get to downtown, the zoo, the locks, and other restaurants in different neighborhoods. The parking spot is a little tricky with a pole and 2 cars that never seemed to be gone, but thankfully they put some padding around the pole that protected our car! We had a Ford Edge and I wouldn't recommend bringing anything much bigger here. 
Since this is right off Aurora/99 and almost to the Fremont Bridge, there isn't much to walk to around the neighborhood (with kids anyway), but that didn't bother us. 
Timothy and Brittney were great hosts!! They answered questions promptly and were very helpful. They provided us with a pack n play, high chair, and baby bath so we didn't have to rent them and my kids were so excited to see coloring books, sticker books, and bubbles!! Very thoughtful. They also put up a light blocking curtain over the patio door when they knew the blinds wouldn't be installed in time. 
The apartment itself was very clean and both beds were comfortable. It was very nice to be able to do laundry mid trip with kids and be able to cook breakfast every morning.

My dream is to use the profits of our labor to start a non-profit company that will help disadvantaged people around the world, afford medical care. Specifically a program that will send doctors from the US to the third world, to train mid-level healthcare workers to effectively treat the sick. I believe that everyone should have equal access to healthcare, regardless of socioeconomic status.

I joke around a lot and act like a kid when I'm around cute little pets. I love plants and growing plants. If I get an avocado (yum!) I plant the seed. 

One indicator of successful people is their ability to choose a greater reward that takes longer to achieve, versus an inferior reward that takes less time. I typically wait the longer period for the greater reward.

After getting detailed instructions by mail, we were able to check ourselves in without any problems and even so Ron stopped by to make sure we got in OK. Since there were only four of us, we never even used the downstairs apartment. The rest of the house was very spacious and beautifully appointed with floor-to-ceiling windows that let in lots of light and provided an amazing view of the city, exactly as advertised. The kitchen was super well equipped with modern appliances and provided everything we needed to have breakfast and dinner with a spectacular view of the Space Needle every day. Despite its convenient proximity to the Seattle Center and downtown areas, the neighborhood is residential, so it was very quiet and there was always street parking available right by the house. We were able to walk to restaurants (though the steep Queen Anne hill is not for the faint of heart - or foot!) and a fabuluous local grocery store was less than five minutes away by car. The house also had other amenities we appreciated, such as the various bathrooms and the extra large washer and dryer. The beds were large and very comfortable with luxurious Egyptian cotton linens. Since we were very lucky to encounter fabulous weather in Seattle, we were also able to enjoy the two upstairs balconies as well as the little patio where a table and two chairs were enough to make our kids happy playing card games there. It did get quite hot in the upstairs bedrooms, though - the ceiling fan in the master bedroom and the extra fan that was provided in the second bedroom could only do so much to battle temperatures around 90. Still, the view was too nice to be given up in order to move into the downstairs bedroom! Overall, we absolutely loved this property and would recommend it without a moment's hesitation."

The little park 3 short blocks away was cute and more geared for younger kids/toddlers which even had a little wading pool for a hot day.

A couple of things that I wish I paid closer attention to in the details before arriving: 1) no face towels are provided but an ample supply of bath towels, 2) although the kitchen had all the plates/utensils/pots/pans to cook there are no condiments so we had to buy our own and 3) the unit is downstairs as others noted so when there are guests upstairs it is a bit loud hearing their foot steps and moving around."

What made our stay really special the location.  We were minutes away from Tangletown (great family friendly restaurants) and Greenlake.  My husband enjoyed running around the lake almost every morning.  We also took our child to several different parks within walking distance.  

We highly recommend this place!

PCC Greenlake - a natural food store near the lake, with 90 min free parking.  A great place to buy wild salmon, local organic produce (NW berries and cherries!), ready meals, etc.  A good place to pick up food if having a picnic.

Woodland Park Zoo - a few minutes drive from the cottage.  Our toddler loved the zoo.   

Ballard Locks and Fish Ladder - our boy loved looking at yachts and boats.

Golden Gardens - nearest beach, I think.

Seattle Center - has a huge fountain.  Seattle Children's Museum was a good place to escape the summer heat.  Older kids may enjoy the Space Needle, EMP and monorail.

University Village - a family friendly mall with a nice, covered play area.  There is a cute toy store next to the play area.  Din Tai Fun in the mall is an excellent Chinese restaurant...authentic food, good service and kid-friendly."

We had originally booked the 2 BR UW/Greenlake apartment for 1 week. Jim had mistakenly double-booked us in the middle of our itinerary dates but was quick to acknowledge and correct the problem. He offered to us another of his properties in an adjacent neighborhood. This was appreciated as it was an upgrade to a charming Craftsman with more space for us (we have twin 1 year old girls). The space was very nice and clean with nice furniture. Jim and the house supervisor Tony were always available for prompt communication via text or email. The kitchen was well stocked for multiple guests (with a very good dishwasher--a PLUS!) and there were plenty of cleaning supplies to clean up after ourselves. 

It is on a busy arterial which can be quite loud during commuting hours if you choose to open windows or leave the front door open. Nevertheless, the kids were well entertained by the sirens of firetrucks every day!

If we weren't selling our house and moving out of the state, we would definitely save this as a location for visiting family members to stay in.  We appreciated our time there! "

had a wonderful stay.  located in a cute safe neighboorhood and close to wonderful markets and restaurants.  Metropolitan 24hr market - nice selection - good veggies.  Macrina bakery/cafe  - yummy baked goods, desserts, and savories.  Both places were great, since I was in chocolate lectures, demos, and panels all day.

I wish had more time to visit nearby chocolopolis and molly moon's ice cream/dairy.  Also, I skipped the amazing selection of coffee in the kitchen and the nearby area to save my tastebuds for chocolate.

5 Spot was a really nice nearby restaurant to meet up with my artist friends with small kids for dinner.

They have a really helpful guidebook of the nearby area.
Breeze was away, but I was able to contact her by text with prompt replies and recommendations.

I was able to cook and prepare simple dishes in the mini kitchen
really nice cookware, knives, and utensils.

quiet, comfy, and relaxing.   The decor has a nice seattle hip vibe.
soft and lux towels and bathrobes.

weather was beautiful, otherwise the cute mini umbrellas would have helpful.

Honestly the pictures don't do it justice. The views were fantastic and the amenities were great. The beds were supper comfortable and the bathroom was big enough for a small family.

It's a little tricky to find but she provides great directions and once we figured out the streets we found it pretty quickly.

The location is perfect. We relied on the public transportation for the first half of our stay and it was easy. We even walked home one evening from the space needle with our two kids and it wasn't half bad. But that last hill to the apartment is a doozy ;)

The last half we rented a car and there was always plenty of room to park out front. We didn't get to meet Rebecca as she was out of town and arrived the day before we left, but she did check in on us to make sure our stay was going well and we didn't need anything once she was back. 

All in all it was a great experience, a great location and a great place to stay. We would definitely book with Rebecca again! "

The house is very clean and all essentials for cooking, laundry, sleeping are available. Location is very convenient to grocery stores. We stayed for 4 nights and we shopped at Trader Joe's and Uwajimaya market for all our grocery needs.  Pike Market, Waterfront, and downtown areas are only 10 minute drive, and they are several trendy restaurants within Capitol Hill that are walking distance.  It's about a mile away from the freeway and it only took us 40 minutes to get to Future of Flight and Boeing tour in Everett. It's also nice that their house is right next to Immaculate Conception church.  It's one of the best choir I've ever seen in many church services that we've attended.

Our host are very gracious to give us a treats upon arrival.  It's well thought of that they have goodies for adults and our kids.  One particularly treat was a chocolate bar from Theo.  As a result, we visited Theo Chocolates, one of Seattle's very own and I highly recommend to check out the place.  It's close to Fremont Bridge, where you'll find the Fremont troll under Aurora Bridge.

I highly recommend this place to stay if you're in Seattle.  The house is conveniently located to stores and Seattle's landmarks, it's clean in a quiet neighborhood, and our hosts are very nice and friendly.  They also have an awesome dog, though I melt for Border Collies.  "

We parked our rental van in the driveway - very convenient! Street parking was easy for my brother's rental. He found parking within a couple houses every time. 

Location is great too - felt like everything we wanted to see was 5-30 minutes away, and found SO MANY great restaurants, playgrounds, cultural experiences, etc. within 15 minutes.

Hi everybody, I’m Jerome and I’ll be your Host. When I’m not working on home improvement projects, I focus my thoughts on things that don’t exist, but could make life and the world better if they did. Some thoughts have matured and become issued patents, while others have kinks yet to be worked out. I record lots of my projects on video for my jeromegipson YouTube Chanel, which have received over a half million views.
I had a lot of allergies when I was young and found that I had to give up eating sugars, dairy, meat, and alcohols, but I haven’t been sick or even had a cold in over 30 years, and I wouldn’t trade my health for anything.

The apartment met all of my expectations, the location was great for us to visit the tourist sights.  It was only myself and 2 kids (8 & 10)  We walked everywhere, there was absolutely no need for a car.  The kids enjoyed the indoor pool at the end of a big day.  I especially loved the cafe downstairs.  Possibly the best cafe latte since I moved to the US 3 years ago!

The only thing that bothered me about the apartment was the noise.  I knew it was going to be noisy, so I wasn't surprised but it still annoyed me slightly.  It was super hot when I was staying so we wanted to open the windows but opening the windows meant letting in all the noise!  I used the fan at night as white noise for the kids and I used ear plugs, so it was ok.  

Overall we had a great stay, we loved Seattle and loved Belltown.  The apartment was perfect for our 3 night stay.  Thanks for all your help while we were there Marilyn!"

Plenty of space, a great pool for the kids to swim in, convenient to Pikes Place Market and the waterfront, and a kitchen so we could save money by eating in.  The beds were comfortable, especially the king size in the master bedroom.  The queen size sofa bed was NOT at all comfortable and only suitable for the kids.  I would not advise an adult sleeping on it. The room was very quiet (we never even heard our neighbors or those above us at any point during the weekend).  The space was clean, and the people at the front desk of Harbor Steps were helpful.  There is a small grocery store/deli on site and a Target with groceries 1.5 blocks away.

Keep in mind the the kitchen is equipped only with the basics.  If you needs any staples, spices, etc. bring them from home or plan on purchasing them.  There was a small container of sugar that was almost empty and a few sugar packets.  We wished we had brought our blender and our electric skillet for making pancakes because the frying pan provided only allowed on pancake at a time.  This is not a complaint -- just making sure guests know what to expect.  

The only negative for us was that the hot tub in the swimming pool area was out of service the entire weekend we were there.  We certainly had been looking forward to soaking while the kids swam, so that was a disappointment.  It was certainly an issue that could happen at any location, but we were disappointed that Harbor Steps did not take action to fix it more quickly.  

There were not pool towels, but there was a dryer in the unit, so it was not a problem.  Guests may want to consider brining their own pool towels from home.

We'd definitely stay there again, and would likely choose a view unit.  Reservations can be made directly through StayAlfred as well, but we could not find any two night stays through them (perhaps they have a 3 night minimum  on their site?) Even with the Airbnb reservation charge, we saved money doing it this way because we found a great Airbnb coupon to use and did not have to reserve for 3 nights.  "

Ever since I was a kid doing sleepovers to my first job out of college as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Turkey all through my long and longer life, I've loved every place I've ever visited.  So maybe that's why I want to return all the great hospitality I've received.

These days I'm a realtime captioner for hard of hearing.  Which means I go to classes, meetings, conferences with students (or staff or faculty) primarily at the University of Washington and write live everything being said so the student can read it on my computer screen as it's happening.  You've seen closed captioning on TV?  It's like that, only I'm there live on site.  Love my job.  It's challenging (that is to say, hard) and can be stressful, but I am glad to be a vehicle for access to education and the workplace that people wouldn't have without that service.  The service is provided under auspices of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

There are so many things to do in Seattle, and I am happy to give you information and ideas for your stay -- or just get out of your way and let you have at it!

She really helped by answering our questions and concerns about our late evening arrival and made sure we had access inside.  We were glad she had set up an air mattress for our 2 boys to stay in the living the first night.  The next 2 nights we had our boys join us in our bedroom.

Danielle was a very caring and easy-going host and especially understanding of our boys' playfulness at times.  Her home was kid friendly which made sense since her 3 year old was also there on some days.  

Overall, the location of the house was very close (about a block walking) to a Metro Bus ride (about 30 minutes long) into Seattle.  This was a great way to sightsee without the hassle of driving through traffic and expense of parking.  Certainly Danielle also made the effort to accommodate our family's needs in the cozy space especially with all of us sharing a bathroom.

The accommodations were adequate for the price. Positives include: parking space in front of the house, access to washer/dryer & kitchen, safe clean environment for kids, pet free for those allergic to animals, and fairly quiet neighborhood setting.  

Things that could be improved include: 
Noisy doors when closing or opening and door knobs that were noisy when turned.

We are General Contractors with a specialty in kitchen and bath remodeling.  I studied Interior Design at Parson's in New York and Bruce joined me one summer for classes at Parson's in Paris.  We are both passionate for design and love the comfortable relaxed and ever so creative philosophy of French design.
We have always loved sharing our art filled home with friends from near and far and offering a relaxing refuge within the city.  When we ended up with an empty nest it seemed a natural fit to share our spacious home with travelers like you. I was a business traveler years ago as a rep for several high end appliance lines, and would have loved a home atmosphere to kick back after a day on the road.  
We love puttering in the kitchen and trying new recipes, so you might get to be a bonafide taster if you hang out with us.  We love gardening but we also love our American Brittany dog Roc, so the garden can at times show signs of a dog.
I have listed languages we speak and although I am by no means fluent in any but English, we can stutter through and manage to communicate in French, Spanish and German.
Sharing Seattle's art and entertainment is always fun for us, so be sure to let us know what you might like to see, from Shakespeare in the Park, and free concerts at the Ballard Locks to Chihuly's Glass Garden, an entertaining night at Jazz Alley or how to get to one of the many sports events our city has to offer on the bus from our place.
We are very understanding hosts and know that you are in a new place and we are here to help you.  Although not part of our regular routine when you visit, if you have just flown in from half way around the world and at midnight you are starving with few options to find a restaurant serving, we can most certainly find something in our kitchen to get you through the night, from soup and sandwiches, to goodies in the refrigerator to warm up for a light supper or midnight breakfast.  We are always glad to help with direction and print out bus schedules or directions for you to take with you on your day of exploring.

******CHARACTER REFERENCES:  

“I have known Pina for 18 years since I first moved to Seattle, when she owned and operated Botticelli Caffe. 

As a frequent customer I was able to watch Pina run both the café and another Restaurant over the years. Pina was a tireless worker, sharing her time between the café, her daughter and all of her many friends made through the business. 

 The clientele was made up of regulars who came in for her great smile and great conversation. Tourists were always given sound advice and direct ions to all of the best Seattle sites.

I was able to work again with Pina on the purchase of my home where she was instrumental in finding the house my family enjoyed for several years along with all the close friends and neighbors Pina was able to introduce during our residence. Pina is always cheerful, dependable and tirelessly working to help those close to her.”  
                
S.B. - Interior Designer

 ******I was a tenant in an apartment building that Pina managed. From inquiring about the apartment, to leasing and maintenance, Pina proved herself to be friendly, responsive, and available. 

My husband and I felt comfortable and well supported while the building was under Pina's management. When a new manager started, there was an unfortunate and noticeable change in the sense of community within the building. 

After experiencing many other apartment managers, I rate Pina as tops. She was always professional, reasonable, and neighborly. I would be lucky to find another manager as caring as Pina.
B.S. - Transportation Consultant

******“I have known Pina  for 15 years as a wonderful friend, reliable apartment manager, prosperous business owner, a professional Realtor and a wonderfully committed mother.

I'm in senior product management at Microsoft, and if I want to make clear that Pina rates highly in all areas in my opinion - interpersonal communications skills, her attention to detail, her ability to socialize or work in a group in a charismatic and professional yet relaxed manner. She would be an asset to many and scores highly in my opinion”

We've stayed in several Airbnbs and this was by far, the best stocked fridge and pantry that we've ever had! Our lovely hosts even found a high chair for our 13 month old to use. It was pretty warm while we were there, but with plenty of open windows and fans that were set up, the cross breezes and circulating air kept the temperature pleasant. 

The Sky Loft is in a great location, walking distance from lots of cool neighborhoods and Greenlake. We used to live in Seattle and were excited to be visiting again and checking out all the different coffee places, parks, and trails that abound in this wonderful city. And, of course, we took advantage of the proximity to PCC! 

If you are also traveling with little kids/babies and curious about how that worked out, read on! Aside from the steep flight of stairs (we had lots of gear to lug up!), it was great. The bedroom is small, but has plenty of room for a pack and play. The best part was that the bedroom is a little separated from the main living space, so when your kiddo goes to sleep early, you don't have to be totally quiet. There was also tons of great white noise for our little one because of the fan and traffic whooshing by. The floors are a bit hard, so we kept constant watch on our toddler, who just started walking a few weeks ago, but we pretty much have to do that all the time, anyway. =) She loved the ample floor space and the elevated kitchen. She kept going around and around in circles. It was also nice to be able to eat outside on the deck -- less clean up for our messy little one. And, of course, being able to do laundry in the unit itself is perfect! There were also plenty of extra linens and towels, which came in handy. No bathtub, but a pretty big kitchen sink where we were able to bathe our baby. Overall, and compared to other places we've stayed, a very family friendly home and location!"

After warming it up it once stayed warm without much heat after that. Very cozy! 
When we arrived she stocked the cupboards with tea, coffee and instant oatmeal. There is a full stove and refrigerator but no microwave. I loved that she had a compost, recycling and trash container for our use and a basket of toiletries in the bathroom too! There is a little CD/radio on the kitchen counter so you can play music if you wish. She also had a basket with a small selection of toys and books for kids plus a few books on the book shelves for the adults. That was nice a nice touch if we wanted something to read during our stay.

We love LA, NY, MIA and all in between, but Seattle is our city. We are small business owners and thought Airbnb would be an interesting new venture at a less stressful pace.  We are very casual after business hours :) and a very social couple.  We enjoy meeting people from different cultures and love to entertain.

Prez:  I have been blessed with opportunities to travel many places (or at least many places to us), love new experiences and seeing historic land marks. We take pride in our city's beauty, rich culture and past good or bad.

I've worked for myself most of my life and love being creative . I enjoy graphic design, acting rapping, video production, editing, directing, ballin' and shot callin' (a little urban humor) LOL. I truly want to do everything. I was a volunteer fire fighter with the Seattle Fire Department, EMT and certified life guard. ( I told you I want to do everything)

I have a lot of day activity and nightlife connections with the transportation company I manage, if you want to do a little exploring- we've got the hook up.  We like to let our guests determine if they want some private personal time while using our space or want the works with sight seeing suggestions and even the option of tagging along with us for some fun. (Warning it can get a little crazy with us, especially once the party bus gets rolling, lol ). It is very common to see buses coming or going from our property at various hours of the day and night.  You can book airport / train / bus pick ups and drop off'(email hidden), please enter airbnb as the referral to receive a discount.

We are open to any and all guests as along as everyone is respectful and polite.  Your race, sexual preference or religion is respected as long as you extend the same respect. Our space has its own keyless entry so you're welcome to come and go as you please without worrying about disturbing the rest of the house. 

I hope to have you stay with us...check out our reviews and book a night!

PS: THIS IS NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL, WHATS IN THE PHOTOS IS IN THE HOUSE.

The room size was enough for 3 of us ( me & 2 kids) and clean just like the same as the photos in Airbnb. The only issue was the hot weather. When I visited, the weather in Seattle was extremely hot, therefore my room which located upstairs were hot as well. Thankfully, they already set up a nice A/C in my room that I can control in my taste, but it still took couple of ours to cool down my room temperature. Sometimes I should turn on the AC whole night, witch was noisy and made my throat dry. But, the hot weather is not their fault. Who can even control the weather?

We swear by good strong organic coffee, jasmine green tea, yogurt, fresh fruits, homemade jams and cereal for breakfast. We're strong believers in Dutch-style snacking between meals. The grill is our friend, pizza our buddy, fresh foods our allies.

We embrace simplicity, are budget and eco conscious, which allows us to take trips, and eat mostly organically grown food. 
Between the two of us we know a lot about cultural life in Seattle, from the music scene and theaters to museums, restaurants and shopping, and we know our way around in the ±200 parks. We've traveled extensively in the Pacific Northwest and love sharing our finds with visitors.

One of my biggest pleasures in life is learning about a new place, new people, new food- both through my own travels and as a host.  My friends would describe me as active, open, engaging, funny and liberal. I was raised in the deep South of the USA (Georgia), the youngest of 5 siblings, but have lived in Seattle for 25+ years. Seattle is a hot bed of music talent, and I take advantage of it by staying updated on emerging talent and attending as many live performances as I can. I am often the oldest person there, but so what! You could not ask for a better city to live in if you are a foodie, as I am.  The variety here is unbelievable. My profession is Interior Design, so of course, design and art are an important part of my life. Books, and more books- don't even try to talk to me if I have a book in my hand!

I have three absolutely gorgeous and brilliant daughters who no longer live with me, which naturally makes them even more attractive! They live in Los Angeles and San Francisco and I visit them often.

My travels have included, but are not restricted to: most of the states within the USA, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Argentina, Cuba, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, Morocco, South Africa, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and China. I love hiking, camping, and staying places off the beaten tourist path. I will always choose a host over a hotel- how better to really learn something about the place you bothered to travel?

Once upon a time, I spoke pretty decent Italian, but am rusty and out of practice. I would love some Italian guests to practice with (or rather, ""with whom to practice"", as I will claim to be a grammar expert). My French is even rustier. I have begun to study Spanish recently. I have a great love of the English language and grammar- yes, I was that person in school who loved diagramming sentences, and always had my hand in the air to answer the grammar questions while everyone else's eyes were rolling back in their heads! I am TESOL certified (Teacher of English as a Second Language), and hope to live abroad and teach at some point in my future. In the meantime, I have volunteered to teach English to refugees here in Seattle. Combining hosting and teaching have great appeal to me.

Todd has a beautiful small (although felt much bigger than it was due to the layout) house near a dead end street overlooking Lake Washington and Seward Park.  The windows from the dining room had a fantastic view!  Todd has 3 young kids (so do we), and there were lots of toys in the kid's room (3 small beds) along with a train table, which made my kids feel right at home.  Outside there is a wooden play house/fort on the side yard, chicken coop with swing attached, and vegetable planters.  The highlight for our kids was probably the ramp that rolled a ride on top car down the hill in the back yard.  They probably did that 100 times each.  :)  There is no TV, but none of us really realized it, we were too busy planning our next outing, and the kids were too busy playing.  We were there over SeaFair weekend, and the location couldn't have been much better.  We could see the airshow going on out the front window, and hear the hydroplanes.  We took a quick 5 minute walk down the stairs at the end of the street and ended up at the bike path along Lake Washington.  We didn't even get a chance to explore Seward Park, but it is right there.  All the amenities you would really need, in a nice, clean, comfortable house with great views and a safe, semi-ritzy neighborhood.  We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 nights!  Thank you Todd for letting us borrow your house! "

Bathroom was clean and towels were nice and soft.

Location is quiet on side street with designated off street gravel parking space.  Short walk down side of house to back yard.  Back yard was nice with a swing, kid's playhouse, and patio furniture. 

Two potential negatives:
1.  Walk down to back yard could be a problem for someone who is mobility challenged.  Not an issue for us, but if this is a concern for you probably not the best location.

2. There is some musty smell.  It is a basement apartment in Seattle, so this is to be expected, but if you are sensitive to this it could be a problem.  We opened windows and it was less noticeable each day.

Besides that, we enjoyed our stay.  Location is nice and quiet and close to I-5 which let's you get around town quickly.  Family lives upstairs, but is quiet and respectful."

Benjamin was very responsive, friendly, and even had a nice bottle of WA wine in the fridge and coffee in the grinder for our arrival.  We did not meet in person but texted and email to good effect.  We did not use the cottage garden-like side yard but enjoyed the view. The location is in a quiet family neighborhood - convenient and close to U. WA and Hwy 5, but quiet inside.

Pros-
1]Nick and Nicole were excellent in correspondence. So booking and other getting answers to any of your queries was quick and prompt.
2]  Since we were arriving late around midnight the lockbox for keys was very convenient.
3]Apt was small but clean 
4] The biggest plus is pretty close to downtown and highway 5!
5] Nice to have a kitchen for light cooking.

Cons-
1] If you have a car , street parking is little difficult to find :(. Outside apt it has 2 hrs parking restriction.
2] We stay in july at it was extremely hot and AC would have been comfortable.
Apt has just one ok fan.
3] As soon as you open the door there are railing not pretty safe for younger kids.
You have be little careful if you have kids.
4] No elevator so if you have luggage you need to climb the staircase to reach the 3rd floor!
5] Street noise is a pain if you are used to silence while sleeping.

Overall it is a good place to stay if you want to visiting Seattle!"

About me:
I am 34 years old born in Seattle and grew up just outside the city in Kirkland, WA. I know the area very well and can offer great insights if you let me know a bit about what your plans are and what you would like to do and explore. As for me, recently I have been spending a lot of time on my new boat and doing restoration work. I'm around and responsive to general questions or recommendations. 

My dog:
I have a female dog named Lucky who is about 8 years old now and comes with me sometimes. She still acts like a puppy and has a bad habit of jumping up on people that I don't think I will ever train her out of. Lucky is harmless and has never bitten anyone but she can become territorial at times. 

A little more about my background if your curious:
I am a former pro athlete who has worked as a personal trainer and group exercise instructor. I transitioned from one on one training to group exercise sessions leading hour long classes aimed at high intensity cardio, targeted strength building movement patterns and stretching. I'm not currently teaching but am working on the choreography for my next class/bootcamp and hope to teach again soon. I'd love to have my guests join when that time comes. In the meantime I am dedicated to making sure your Airbnb experience is a great one.

PROS:
-location location location.  spend more on being in the heart of things, especially if you have kids that nap.  you won't waste time traveling.  plus this apartment is a 10min walk to volunteer park, which has a great splash pool + playground. public transportation (the bus stops in front of the apartment), cafes, restaurants, ice cream, grocery store, yoga, pilates... it's all right there.
-fully functioning kitchen with dish soap, dish rags, ice cubes, coffee maker, etc.
-fast wifi.
-uncluttered apartment.
-apartment gets great light, has nice views of plants/trees, and with open windows you get a crosswind.
-1 bedroom (which means you have a separate space from the sleeping quarters).
-includes shampoo, body wash, towels.  the little things make a huge difference.
-easy check in/out.  claire was accommodating and met us to give us the key, when checking out we just left the key in the apartment.
-claire is so sweet.  i don't expect her to do this with everyone, but she refunded us a night (we had airline problems and didn't arrive until the next day), and had coffee stocked in the apartment.  she was so smiley when we met, she's the kind of person you'd want to be friends with.

CONS:
-could be cleaner (this is actually not a con for us, but i could see others being bothered).  dust mites in the corners.
-the shower head is like a garden hose. totally not a deal breaker for us, but again, for others i could see this as annoying.
-the building is older, so sound travels.  we travel with a sound machine app so it was not a problem but without the white noise to block it out, it could be a little loud with neighbors and traffic.

things to keep in mind:
-no tv. we don't watch tv and travel with our iPad so this didn't bother us at all, others might miss it.
-no laundry on site. something to keep in mind. claire did generously offer laundry services but we didn't need it.
-if you are traveling with kids, keep in mind that there is only one queen bed. the bedroom is not large, but it could fit an air mattress on the floor for your littles if need be.

honestly i have to stretch for the cons, as for us personally they were non issues.  we had a lovely stay and would stay here again without a blink.  thank you claire!

When we first arrived we we’re not sure what door to knock on, so we went towards the back as we had mentioned checking in at 3. Maria was a feeling a bit under the weather, but was super nice and helpful, gave us a quick tour, showed us where the cold beers and snacks were and that was the end of our interaction while there (which was totally cool with us).

The place is very nice and clean. The entry way has a nice table to sit and drink a cup of coffee. But I think the upstairs is the gem of this place. Very well lit, and it has a nice closet and plenty of space. There is no AC and we were there in probably the hottest day in Seattle, but just the windows open, really air the room and keep it really cool. There is a park pretty much across the street some on a weekend you hear some people/kids playing, and there was a concert at the park or something one of the nights but it wasn’t bad. Whlist the bedrooms and the entry are great, the bathroom and sitting/dresing room are really shallow, the ceilings are really low. I am 6’2” and I think the highest point of these might be 6’3”… the bathroom is small but very functional, if you are below 5’9” you might not feel at cramped. 

Over all the place is nice, and Maria was great. "

My hobbies include meditation, kung -fu, and metaphysical studies.

Occasionally we will take the resort route but for the most part we prefer to stay in other people's homes for a home away from home experience. We've done home swaps with other families as well.

We were in town for my sisters wedding with my 4 kids, grandma and great grandma...... Laurie has thought of everything! I had gone to the grocery store to pick up supplies with out checking out the house first. She already had every kitchen condiment you could think of plus shampoo and soaps in each bathroom!  
So many conveniences that were greatly appreciated during the wedding madness...
The kids loved having their own area downstairs and we didn't have to hear their craziness...Lol
There was so much space to spread out that even the adults could find places to get away if they needed to do so.
We enjoyed gathering around the huge kitchen table playing cards and catching up with family.
Believe me, we are definitely booking this house again when we return to Seattle. 
Book it! You won't be disappointed!

The location was very easy to find, and there was parking right out front for easy access.

The apartment is immaculate, spacious and comfortable.

Two things to be aware of:

1. The fold-out bed is a partial fold-out couch - there's not a full mattress in there. This is fine for a couple of nights with one person, but I wouldn't want to have a couple sleep there, or sleep there for very long. Probably fine for kids though!

2. Light sleepers should know that there's a knocking sound at night - water heater maybe?

It's a clean space in a safe, quiet neighborhood. 
Glyn is very warm and gracious, however, we didn't get a lot of opportunity for chit chat because she and her husband had their kids visiting, so they were busy, and we keep to ourselves and were mainly there just to sleep. 
You have to eat at Red Mill Burgers, Zeeks pizza, and of course Starbucks, all a very short walk away. Greenlake is also very close and a wonderful place to get a walk, run, skate, or bike in; you can make a big walk out of it by walking to greenlake from the space and back. 
Plenty of parking, just be aware that people in the neighborhood park very close to cars. 
If you need a basic place to stay, you don't like hotels (especially Seattle has a lot of cruddy ones, most have criminal activity unless you stay downtown Seattle in a 4-5 star), stay here. It's very safe, quiet, centrally located, and will give you an idea of what Seattle is like!  I love the way the recycling techniques are posted on the wall, I'm all about recycling and composting, it was so helpful to have the details posted!

A quaint and welcome alternative to staying in a hotel, and also less expensive for a week-long August visit.  The apartment itself is tastefully decorated, and comfortable.   Although the bed is smaller than what we are used to, we slept comfortably, especially after Jeffrey provided us with a 2nd comforter so we didn't keep pulling the original one off each other at night. Overall, we did feel like we were staying in a vacation cottage in a more remote location than just minutes from downtown Seattle. 

The location was perfect for our needs, although driving up/down the W Dravus hill can be quite intimidating the first few times.  But as we discovered during our week in Seattle, this is true for most of the Seattle neighborhoods. The neighborhood is beautiful.  Our son's apartment was about a 1/2 mile from Jeffrey's apartment, so our other 2 kids stayed with him, and we were able to easily meet up with them for our daily excursions.  From here we were able to easily get to all of our destinations in and around Seattle.

Jeffrey is a friendly and gracious host.  He helped us get our luggage up to the apartment on arrival, and down to our car on departure.  You do have to negotiate steps outside, and a flight of stairs inside to get in/out of the apartment.

The french pastries Jeffrey delivered to us on our first morning were a delicious start to our Seattle vacation.  And his restaurant recommendations were right on...'Un Bien' is the best sandwich place around.

We thoroughly enjoyed our conversations with Jeffrey.  We have some overlap in our careers, so hearing about his career and life experiences was interesting. 

We will definitely check Jeffrey's apartment for availability the next time we visit Seattle, and recommend it to any of our relatives and friends that may visit in the future. 

This was our first Airbnb experience, and our first visit to Seattle.  Thank you, Jeffrey, for making it an enjoyable one."

It has a blend of whimsical creativity, a stellar hillside location on Lake Union and the canal, and continuous things to see and do in a comfortable, neighborhoody way. It's casual and low key, with a lingering hippie vibe. And our wedding reception was at the Lake Washington Rowing Club. Yes, it's on Lake Union, but, well, that's Fremont. The building is immediately located in a very Fremontian convergence of single family, multi-family & light industry, so there are small apartment buildings, single family homes and a busy ventilation company all in the same vicinity.  Sometimes it can be noisy, and at other times surprisingly quiet. For entertainment, there is the annual Fremont Solstice Parade, the 4th of July fireworks plus the year-round Sunday market. Then there are the permanent sculptural fixtures such as the troll sculpture with its VW Bug under Hwy. 99, the Rapunzel neon light ","There is NO television. We do have good WI-FI.

I stayed there for three months during summer internship with another intern, and if I would be in the same situation again I would just try to get here before trying anything else. 

We came to a house with full fridge and lots of other food/drinks ready for us. Jim gave us two bicycles with locks and helmets to use during the summer, and we had a car available, on a gentleman agreement to be responsible for it and give him some extra money, depending on how much we end up using it. Plus, we had a lady clean the house every other week.

Given all these additional perks, I would highly recommend the place for longer stays. I think it was non-standard even for nice people trying to make stay as comfortable as possible. However, I am not sure if the price would make it worth for a short (weekend) stay. But on the other hand, I have no idea what are other prices like.

Note that the place is in a steep hill (which I did not realize, but actually liked). The house itself is reasonably large, with garage/basement that is large, but half of it is taken by random stored items.

The only negative thing I could point out is that some people with allergy could have problems with pillows/duvets that are provided as default. I started sneezing a little bit after arrival, and it got better after I took them away. There are blankets and other pillows in the house, so this was not a problem for me. And one bed is relatively tall, so probably not suitable for small kids.

In summary, I stayed for 3 months during summer internship, and am more than satisfied with my stay."

Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.

    The sheets were leftover from a camp(old and worn) and the rugs in the bathroom needed to be washed. 
   Since there was only one washcloth provided, my husband got it as he washed up first.
   It was very isolating and we were very frustrated by the situation."

You wind through a lovely garden area to reach the main door which faces a very nice patio. There is a serene garden under the birch trees and arbor at the side of the bungalow with a dining table and fountain. Unfortunately we encountered enough rain on our visit that we really couldn't take advantage of the outdoor amenities but we did enjoy that they were visible from our snug and dry quarters.  Barbara was a very thoughtful hostess. She provided staples (and then some) in the kitchen including milk and bread, oatmeal and fresh fruit and coffee. Barbara was in a class when we arrived and her husband, Tim, gave us a guided and thorough tour of our accommodations and was ready to give us suggestions of what to see in the area. We weren't like many guests in that we knew the area well as our children had been living about two blocks away for the last 9 years. We didn't need much help in finding things to do but there were maps and guide books available if you need them. The location is perfect for getting around as the bus stop is just 2 blocks away. It's only 3 blocks to the grocery store, some wonderful little shops and really good restaurants. If you choose to stay at the Secret Garden, you will not be disappointed. "

There is an awesome coffee shop, donut shop, and brewery only a couple of blocks away.  Green Lake is only a block away with a wide variety of outdoor activities available. Seattle is a large city; however this neighborhood though close to so many things in the city, feels set apart from the hustle and bustle of Seattle.  It was also really nice to meet a variety of other airbnb guests from all different places across the U.S. and the world who stopped for anywhere from 1 day to a few weeks.

I love the houses, my neighbors, and the short walk to anything one could need - grocery store, drugstore, hardware store (very important to an old house owner), a wonderful array of restaurants from Afghani to Thai. It's also a really good neighborhood for walks, as the houses around here are quite well taken care of, and many of them have lovely gardens.  If you like pet-patting as I do, there are a lot of dog owners walking their pets throughout the day, and I have found them to be quite generous in sharing the affection of their dogs. Neighborhood safety:  Wallingford is a very safe neighborhood, and I have never felt personally unsafe either at home or walking around, no matter the hour.

The apartment was super spacious, light, airy and clean we almost wanted to stay there the whole time, we felt at home. The rooftop has a gorgeous view of the Seattle skyline. There is a little bit of noise at night but nothing compared to the freeway and siren sounds I'm used to in LA. 

We didn't use the children's room but we peeked inside and it was really cute, a teen's dream.

Hi everybody, I’m Jerome and I’ll be your Host. When I’m not working on home improvement projects, I focus my thoughts on things that don’t exist, but could make life and the world better if they did. Some thoughts have matured and become issued patents, while others have kinks yet to be worked out. I record lots of my projects on video for my jeromegipson YouTube Chanel, which have received over a half million views.
I had a lot of allergies when I was young and found that I had to give up eating sugars, dairy, meat, and alcohols, but I haven’t been sick or even had a cold in over 30 years, and I wouldn’t trade my health for anything.

I'm a modern calligrapher and home stylist.  I love long walks on the beach, tiny butterflies, chalkboards and headstands.  I hate cooking so much that I once made my husband eat tacos for 30 days straight because it was the only recipe I could stomach.   

If I could live anywhere in the world, it would be Paris.  And I'd give tours of the famous Paris flea markets, eat baguettes without gaining weight, and wear striped shirts whilst riding a bicycle.  I'd have a tiny dog and big hair.  But not a tiny dog WITH big hair, because that would be weird.  But back to reality.  

I really, really love houses and everything related to decorating them.  My favorite holiday is Halloween because it means that I get to sneak a peek inside of beautiful Southern homes (oh, we live in Texas now... did I mention that?).  Anyway, I wanted to make this vacation home truly fabulous, fun and filled with charm.

Secure parking, keypad entry, even building security at night. Although the neighborhood never once made us feel unsafe, these are great things to have in any downtown city. I would caution parents of small children; this condo is not child safe. That said, I did travel with my very well behaved 3 year old and had no issues. My main concern were the windows as if they are open there isn't much to keep a small child from falling out. I would not change a thing about them, just a warning to parents.

It is easy to walk to the waterfront, ferry terminal, Seattle center etc. The roof deck was a great place for our 2 yo to run around. That is the good part.

The place was clean when we arrived, but apparently, we never got entered as staying there in the rental agency computer. A cleaning person came in the middle of our stay to collect some sheets that were in the washing machine, and was surprised that we were there.

A number of light bulbs were out when we arrived. Calls, emails, and texts to the host were not returned. Finally, we got someone at the main rental property office and there were surprised that we were in the unit since we weren't on the calendar. The lack of attention to our stay put a damper on our stay. (One upside was that it was easier to request a  late check-out). But, based on other reviews, I'm guessing that our stay was an anomaly. 

A note for those travelling with younger children, there is no kitchen table, but a bar with high stools and some collapsible ""tv dinner"" tables that can be used with a couch.

The apartment was easy to get to, my wife and I had no car the entire trip and we didn't need one. We arrived in SEATAC, rode the light rail to downtown Seattle, and walked less than a mile to the building, all for less than 7.50 for the both of us. We were able to follow our host's instructions easily, and had a private room and bathroom that was clean and well stocked with toiletries and linens. The atmosphere in the apartment is definitely mature, I would not have felt comfortable with bringing children here. (There are expensive and fragile things in this apartment).There is no TV, which is GREAT, because you should be out walking this beautiful city! The first night, I called the space needle restaurant, Sky City, booked a last minute table, and walked the two blocks and had the best Halibut I've ever tasted. The views were incredible, especially since the entire stay it was 75 degrees and sunny. Yeah. Be jealous. We were able to walk to any part of downtown Seattle within 15 minutes, and we could've taken public transit, but it was too pretty to pass up walking around the city. I recommend waking up early and running or biking through the Olympic Sculpture Park, which is right down the way from the apartment. Mr. Mahmud is kind enough to offer full use of his kitchen and cooking utensils, as well as laundry facilities. This isn't a hotel though, it's a person's life! If you can't handle the quirks and unique experience of living in someone else's home for a few days, you'd be better off in a boring hotel. I only wish I had been able to spend more time with our host, as he seemed like quite an interesting and unique person. The bed is low to the ground for those who would struggle to get up and out, but it is amazingly comfy! The view is great, the location is perfect, and the hospitality was warm. "

I wanted a private, furnished space, near my daughter's apt. on Capitol Hill and I found what I wanted. Michael's condo was exactly as described/pictured on the website, no surprises. I live in a small mid-western community, am a middle-class retired professional and wanted to spend a week or so in this very busy, urban area with my daughter, but we both need our own ""space and time"", i.e., privacy. I was amazed and pleased with the whole experience. Michael returned messages quicker than I could with easy answers or explanations. The location turned out to be about 1/2 block away from my daughter, which made everything more convenient and within easy walking distance. I was ready to reserve a motel room until I found this venue and thought his price was more than fair, as everything was provided and ready to go. I had not seen more than the 1st and 2nd reviews of Michael's condo, and I think you should know that cleanliness was NOT an issue. I'm kind of a ""germaphobe"", so if there was a problem, it's been resolved! My daughter had seen two later reviews re: cleanliness, but didn't tell me until we both saw the condo. She apparently had ""antennae"" working overtime and I heard a huge sigh as she walked a few steps ahead. She turned around with obvious relief, said to me, ""I was so worried, Mom, and this is very clean..."" and I had no idea what she was talking about! I had some questions about the space/use of items and Michael was readily available. He offered  transportation to or from the airport, left a list with neighborhood restaurants and coffee shops. I found Michael and the whole experience very welcoming and friendly. I hope to rent his condo again. Thanks, Michael...."

If I used dishes, she would wash them. We could also use her kitchen if wanted to, but we were out and about all day so there was no need. The bathroom was communal, but it was tidy and cleaned daily.
To sum it all up, it was a very pleasant experience and would recommend to anyone, especially anyone with children and would like to comforts from home away from home. 
Flor as the hostess was very kind. I felt like I was visiting an aunt I had never met before. On the last day, she was having a BBQ with her family and she invited us to join, but we were trying to get the last sights in. 
I wish Flor much success in her business. She's done an amazing thing coming from another country and raising a family. "

The house was the perfect size, simply furnished and nearly baby-proof. 

The location was convenient to everything that we had planned. There was a quaint, suburban downtown close by. Belltown and Downtown Seattle are less than 15 minutes away. 

The property would have been perfect if it was equipped with dressers for the bedrooms, and a few more items in the kitchen, especially a coffee maker. Having the washer and dryer was essential for our stay.

L was readily available for questions and local suggestions, adding to our fantastic weekend. I highly recommend this Airbnb."

Because it was so cold we were not able to take advantage of the wonderful outdoor area but had spectacular views of the lake and the changing weather over it (including from the upstairs bath and shower!)  House was very easy for a family to be in and it was easy to cook for and feed six adults when the whole family congregated for Thanksgiving dinner and other meals.

The parking space provided was great, as was access to different areas of Seattle. The rental property people were quick to answer questions, which was helpful. Water in the fridge was also appreciated. All in all, everything you need is here.

We stay in Seattle every summer, but usually in Ballard or Fremont.  If you are not looking to be in one of the more trendy, hip Seattle neighborhoods, then this place would be a sound choice.  The apartment itself is older, with indoor/outdoor carpeting, older linoleum (the small bit of wood flooring was nice), older window shades, a very small bathroom and an under performing shower. The fluffy  towels provided are adequate if you plan to stay for a shorter amount of time, but otherwise if you stay with four people as we did for a week, then you might have to use the coin operated/shared laundry. The internet did not consistently work.  I found that the pictures on the site made the apartment look newer and bigger than it really is. I would say this is best for two people, but it would be a very tight fit for 6, as we felt it was small with two adults and two children. 
But we tend to look for very modern places to stay in more trendy neighborhoods, so if you are looking for a solid place to stay in the Seattle area and aren't picky about the things I mention, then this would be a good choice."

My favorite vacation destination is Alaska in the fall for the scenery, wildlife and abundant mushroom hunting.  I keep chickens for eggs, entertainment, and occasional stewing.  I like to ferment vegetables, berries, honey, kombucha, and other wild things for both drinking and eating.  I am learning to grow food, but really prefer foraging for wild foods.  I love to cook, especially foraged treasures.  And, I love spending time outdoors exploring via hiking, snowshoeing, skiing, climbing, fishing, swimming and biking.  Favorite vacations usually involve one or more of the above activities.  I am also obsessed with finding beach glass.

I am recently retired from a career in civil engineering to be a stay-at-home mama to baby Elza (born last summer) and to spread more of my love and attention to the Passiflora Farm.  Elza and I share the upkeep with Owen, who also has a day job with the County as a traffic engineer.  We both volunteer with the Seattle Farm Co-op.

The place itself is recently remodeled, in my favorite part of Seattle, and near some of the best places to eat and drink in the city. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, and although parking can be a bit annoying Seattle is a very friendly city to be in without a car (ample carshare programs, bike lanes, and mass transit). That said, I rented a car and had no trouble at all.

I’d recommend a few great drinking spots (The Lookout, for instance), but Hannah will do a much more thorough, polite, and useful job than I will. The hosts are wonderful, and a great perk is the bedrooms have been renovated with AirBNB in mind - little touches like a towel rack in the bedroom make a big difference.

I love to hike, ski, mountain bike, kayak, dig in the dirt, eat good food, and travel.  My husband is a furniture designer  whose workshop is located in the ""Center of the Universe"" (Fremont!) and is now the designated grill master with his specialty; wild Alaskan Salmon caught by our son!  Our other son was instrumental in getting this apartment up and running. Both occasionally come by for a few days at a time. 

We also have a karelian bear dog  that is now older than me in dog years. She is sweet, mellow, and loves a hello. She lives outside during the days and when we are home joins us upstairs. She often takes doggy vacations with our son for a few days or longer that she absolutely loves.
  
I spend my winter months surrounded by sweet, loving 6, 7, and 8 year olds teaching them to read and love books!

She checked up on us regularly throughout the trip, offering up places to visit and grab a bite to eat, playing a huge role in how we planned our days.
On top of an incredibly kind hostess, the environment itself was nothing like I had ever stayed at before. Greenery and artwork were at every corner, the photos posted for this listing really do not do the rooms justice. It was like the B&B was like a whole place on it's own to explore. Our stay at this specific B&B is one of the main reasons why our trip was so enjoyable.

One thing to really keep in mind, though, is that this is more of a quiet environment. If you're the type of person who knows they're noise or maybe enjoys listening to loud music while they get ready, you might want to consider another place to stay. The B&B itself is beyond words, beautiful in so many ways, and the hostess is so attentive and kind, but might not be the place for a family with super active children or someone who doesn't necessarily enjoy being on the quiet side. Just something to keep in mind."

Great neighborhood! Comfortable, well appointed studio.

I loved walking two blocks from Fabio's studio to Westcrest Park, with beautiful views of downtown Seattle. The park includes wide, open space and lovely forest trails. There's a community garden, children's playground, and two dog parks - one for ""small, shy dogs.""

The dreamy mural on the studio wall adds a nice ambiance. I really liked all the furnishings. Quite a nice, contemporary look.

Try Fabio's coffee, imported from Italy. You'll find it in your kitchen, waiting for you! Along with assorted teas. He's a very considerate host. Delightful man to talk to.

Easy walk 2 blocks to catch busses. "

There is a great park for children across the street, with a water fountain to wade in on warm days (admittedly few this June). Volunteer and Interlaken Parks are other nearby attractions an easy walk away. 19th Avenue in the easternmost part of Capitol Hill has changed since we lived in Seattle, adding a nice (though pricey) grocery along with a new restaurant and gourmet ice cream along with the good options (the Kingfish and Fuel) that were already there. As for Mr. Z's apartment, it's eclectically and quirkily decorated with interesting art; comfortable and reasonably spacious for a one bedroom; the price is reasonable for Seattle; staying in the Singles building is fun if you have some nineties-era nostalgia; and the host himself could not be more generous and welcoming.

They were flexible in times for our arrival, and made sure we knew our way around the apartment and the neighborhood.  The accommodations, including the king-size bed and private entrance were more than comfortable!  Having a separate tv / coffee room at the entrance, including a futon, was a bonus.  We certainly never felt crowded. The decor and amenities felt luxurious.
    We were there visiting our grandchildren and stayed in the apartment little time. However, after one of us had to leave Seattle early because of a family emergency Philippe and Siham even brought crepes for a special breakfast to console the one left behind.
  Our only caveat for long-term guests is that you should be aware the quarters were limited in space and equipment for cooking and eating meals.  There was only a coffee maker and a nice toaster oven, as well as a small refrigerator. This was a new rental when we visited, so the hosts may change that in the future.
  Overall, we can't say enough nice things about the apartment and our hosts. We hope to go back soon and won't hesitate to stay there again.
