## Project Title
udacity-datascience-capstone Sparkify project  for Shayan Ray

## Summary of the project

The goal of this project was to:
- perform Churn prediction for users using a music app . The data used was a subset (128MB) of the full dataset available (12GB).

## summary of the results of the analysis
Based on exploratory data analysis I have used the following features to come up with a model for churn prediction

Useful features for model building

#### Categorical:
- - gender
- - level

#### Numerical:
- - number of unique songs played per userId
- - number of total songs played per userId
- - number of unique artists per userId
- - number of Ads action per userId
- - number of thumb down action per userId
- - number of thumbs up action per userId
- - number of friends added per userId
- - number of days after initial registration per userId

Based on the size of the dataset used and features generated and limited experiments performed, RandomForestsClassifier appears to be a decent choice for churn prediction with a F1 score of 0.5121 on the validation dataset. (7 churned users and 13 not-churned users)
